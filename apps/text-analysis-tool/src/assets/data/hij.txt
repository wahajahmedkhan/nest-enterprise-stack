How Mind Over Mood
Can Help You
An oyster creates a pearl out of a grain of sand. The grain of sand irritates the oyster.
In response, the oyster creates a smooth, protective coating that covers the sand and
provides relief. This protective coating is a beautiful pearl. For an oyster, an irritant
becomes the seed for something new and beautiful. Similarly, Mind Over Mood will help
you develop something new: beneficial skills to lead you out of your current discomfort.
The skills you learn by using this book will help you feel better and will continue to
have value in your life long after your original problems are gone.
We hope that, like many people who have learned the methods taught in this book,
you will look back at the initial discomfort that led you to Mind Over Mood as a “blessing
in disguise,” because it provided you the opportunity and motivation to develop pearls
of wisdom and invaluable new perspectives that will help you enjoy the rest of your life
more fully.
How Will This Book Help You?
Mind Over Mood teaches you strategies, methods, and skills that have been shown to be
helpful with mood problems such as depression, anxiety, anger, panic, jealousy, guilt,
and shame. The skills taught in this book can also help you solve relationship problems,
handle stress better, improve your self-esteem, become less fearful, and grow more confident. These strategies also can help you if you are struggling with alcohol or drug use.
Mind Over Mood is designed to teach you skills in a step-by-step fashion, so you can rapidly make the changes that are important to you.
The ideas in this book come from cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), one of
today’s most effective forms of psychotherapy. “Cognitive” refers to what we think and
how we think. Cognitive-behavioral therapists emphasize understanding the thoughts,
beliefs, and behaviors connected to our moods, physical experiences, and events in our
2 Mind Over Mood
lives. A central idea in CBT is that our thoughts about an event or experience powerfully
affects our emotional, behavioral, and physical responses to it.
For example, if we are standing in line at the grocery store and think, “This will
take a while. I might as well just relax,” we are likely to feel calm. Our bodies stay
relaxed, and we may start a conversation with someone standing nearby or pick up a
magazine. However, if we think, “They shouldn’t have such a long line. They should
hire more clerks,” we may feel upset and irritated. Our bodies become tense and fidgety,
and we may spend our time complaining to other customers and the clerk.
Mind Over Mood teaches you to identify and understand the connections among your
thoughts, moods, behaviors, and physical reactions in everyday situations like this one,
as well as during major events in your life. You will learn to think about yourself and
situations in more helpful ways, and to change the thinking patterns and behaviors that
keep you stuck in distressing moods and relationships. You will discover how to make
changes in your life when your thoughts alert you to problems that need to be solved.
In the end, these changes should help you feel happier, calmer, and more confident. In
addition, the skills you learn using Mind Over Mood help you create and enjoy more positive relationships.
How Will You Know If This Book Is Helping?
For any of us, it is much easier to keep trying something when we know we are making
progress. For example, when we first learn to read, we often begin by learning the alphabet and recognizing individual letters. Initially, we need to put a lot of effort and practice
into recognizing letters. As our skill develops, our recognition of letters becomes easier
and more automatic. Over time, we stop paying attention to individual letters, because
we have learned to put these letters together and learn simple words. As new readers, we
may scan a page looking for words we know. Over time, we develop the skill to read
simple sentences, and we know we are making progress when we can read more complicated sentences, paragraphs, and simple books. Soon we are not attending to individual
words, but to the meaning of what we are reading. In school, children become better
readers year by year, and their reading-level progress can be measured by tests.
Similarly, you will be able to notice and measure the progress you make in using
Mind Over Mood. In the early weeks, you will learn individual skills. Over time, you will
learn to combine these skills in ways that improve your moods and your life. One way
to measure your progress is to measure your moods at regular intervals as you develop
and practice Mind Over Mood skills. Chapter 4 helps you do this and shows you how to
graph your scores so you can see your progress over time.
How to Use This Book
Mind Over Mood is different from other books you may have read. It is designed to
help you develop new ways of thinking and behaving that will help you feel better.
How Mind Over Mood Can Help You 3
These Mind Over Mood skills require practice, patience, and perseverance. Therefore, it is
important for you to complete the exercises in each chapter. Even some of the skills that
look easy can be more complicated than they seem when you actually try to do them.
Most people find that the more time they spend practicing each skill, the more benefit
they get.
In the beginning, it is helpful to spend some time on these skills every day. You may
find it helpful to set aside a regular time each day to read about or practice Mind Over
Mood skills. If you move too quickly through the book without giving yourself adequate
practice time, you will not learn how to apply the skills to your own problems. Thus
speed of learning is not the important thing. It is more important to spend enough time
with each chapter until you understand the ideas and can use them in your life in a way
that is meaningful and helps you feel better. You may find it only takes an hour or so to
do this with some chapters of the book. For other chapters, it will take weeks or even
months of practice before the skills you learn become automatic and you begin to feel
the full benefit.
Mind Over Mood can be customized so that you can read chapters in an order that
is likely to be most helpful for you. For example, if you have chosen this book to work
on particular moods, at the end of Chapter 4 there is a recommendation that you read
the chapters about moods (13, 14, and/or 15) that pertain to you. You can skip any
mood chapters that don’t apply. After you read those chapters, you can follow the chapter sequence recommended for each particular mood or moods. Alternatively, you may
choose to read the book straight through and do the exercises beginning with Chapter
2 and ending with Chapter 16.
If you are using Mind Over Mood as part of therapy, your therapist may recommend a
different order for reading chapters. There are many ways to customize development of
Mind Over Mood skills, and your therapist may have their own idea about which sequence
will work best for you. If you are bringing this book to the attention of your therapist,
you might suggest that he or she read the “A Brief Message for Clinicians and Interested
Readers” on pages xv–xvii.
Can You Use Mind Over Mood Skills for Issues Other Than Moods?
Yes. The same Mind Over Mood skills that help manage moods can also help you with
stress; alcohol and drug use; eating issues such as bingeing, purging, or overeating; relationship struggles; low self-esteem; and other issues. It also can be used to develop positive moods, such as happiness and a sense of meaning and purpose in your life.
What If You Want to Use Worksheets More Than Once?
Throughout the book, there are exercises designed to help you learn and apply the
important skills introduced in that chapter. The worksheets that accompany these exercises are meant to be practiced over time. Additional copies of many of the exercise
4 Mind Over Mood
worksheets can be found in the Appendix at the end of the book (and all of them are
available to download for your personal use at www.guilford.com/MOM2-materials), so that
you can copy and use them whenever you think they might help.

Understanding Your Problems
Ben: I hate getting old.
One afternoon a therapist received a telephone call from Sylvie, a 73-year-old woman
who was concerned about her husband, Ben. She had read an article about depression,
and it seemed to describe him. For the past six months, Ben had complained constantly
about feeling tired; yet Sylvie heard him pacing around the living room at three in the
morning, unable to sleep. In addition, she said he was not as warm as usual toward her,
and he was often irritable and negative. He had stopped visiting his friends and didn’t
seem interested in doing anything. After his doctor checked him and said he didn’t have
a medical problem that would explain these symptoms, Ben complained to his wife, “I
hate getting old. It feels lousy.”
The therapist asked to talk with Ben on the phone, and Ben reluctantly came on the
line. He told the therapist not to take it personally, but he didn’t think much of “head
doctors” and didn’t want to see the therapist because he wasn’t crazy, just old. “You
wouldn’t be happy either if you were 78 and ached all over!” He said he would go to one
appointment just to satisfy Sylvie, but he was sure it wouldn’t help.
How we understand our problems has an effect on how we cope. Ben thought that
his sleep problems, tiredness, irritability, and lack of interest in doing things were normal
parts of growing older. Growing old was something Ben couldn’t change, so he didn’t
expect that anything could help him feel better.
At their first meeting, the therapist was immediately struck by the difference in
Sylvie’s and Ben’s appearance. In a rose-colored skirt with a coordinating floral blouse,
earrings, and shoes, Sylvie had dressed herself carefully for the meeting. She sat upright
in her chair and greeted the therapist with an expectant smile and bright, eager eyes. In
contrast, Ben sat slumped in his chair, and although he was neatly dressed, he had a slight
stubble on the left side of his chin. His eyes were dull and surrounded by the dark circles
of fatigue. He stood up stiffly and slowly to greet the therapist, saying grimly, “Well, you
got me for an hour.”
As the therapist gently questioned Ben over the next 30 minutes, his story slowly
6 Mind Over Mood
unfolded. With each question, Ben sighed deeply and then responded flatly. Ben had
been a truck driver for 35 years, making local deliveries for the last 14 of those years.
After his retirement, he met regularly with three retired friends to talk, eat a meal, or
watch sports. Ben also liked fixing things, working on house projects, and repairing
bicycles for his eight young grandchildren and their friends. He regularly saw his three
children and the grandchildren, and he felt proud to have a good relationship with each
of them.
Eighteen months earlier, Sylvie had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her cancer
had been detected early, and she had recovered well after surgery and radiation treatment, with no further signs of cancer. Ben became teary as he talked about her illness:
“I thought I’d lose her, and I didn’t know what I’d do.” As he said this, Sylvie jumped in
quickly, patting Ben on the arm: “But I’m OK, dear. Everything turned out OK.” Ben
swallowed hard and nodded his head.
While Sylvie was undergoing cancer treatment, one of Ben’s best friends, Louie,
became suddenly ill and died. Louie had been Ben’s friend for 18 years, and Ben felt his
loss deeply. He felt angry that Louie had not gone to the hospital sooner, because early
treatment might have saved his life. Sylvie said that Ben focused all his attention on
tracking her cancer treatment appointments after Louie’s death. “I think Ben thought
he would be responsible for my death if we missed an appointment,” said Sylvie. Ben
stopped seeing his friends and devoted himself to Sylvie’s care.
“After Sylvie’s treatment ended, I knew the relief was only temporary. The rest of
my life will be filled with illness and death. I feel half dead already. A young person like
yourself can’t understand this.” Ben sighed. “It’s just as well. What use am I, anyway?
The grandkids fix their own bikes now. My sons have their own friends, and Sylvie
would probably be better off if I wasn’t here. I don’t know what’s worse – to die, or to
live and be left all alone because all your friends are dead.”
After hearing Ben’s story and reviewing his physician’s report that there was no
physical cause for the way Ben was feeling, it was clear to the therapist that Ben was
depressed. He was experiencing physical symptoms (insomnia, appetite loss, fatigue),
behavior changes (stopping his usual activities, avoiding friends), mood changes (sadness, irritability, guilt), and a thinking style (negative, self-critical, and pessimistic) consistent with depression. As is often the case with depression, Ben had experienced a
number of losses and stresses in the preceding two years (Sylvie’s cancer, Louie’s death,
and the sense that his children and grandchildren didn’t need him any more).
Although Ben was skeptical that therapy could help, with Sylvie’s encouragement he
agreed to go to three more sessions before deciding whether to continue or not.
Understanding Ben’s Problems
During their second meeting, his therapist helped Ben understand the changes he had
experienced in the past two years. Using the five-part model in Figure 2.1 on the facing
page, Ben noticed that a number of environmental changes or major life events (Sylvie’s
Understanding Your Problems 7
cancer, Louie’s death) had led to behavior changes (the end of regular social time with
friends, extra trips to the hospital for Sylvie’s cancer treatment). In addition, he began to
think differently about himself and his life (“Everyone I care about is dying,” “My children and grandchildren no longer need me”) and to feel worse both emotionally (irritable,
sad) and physically (tired, more trouble sleeping).
Notice that the five areas of Figure 2.1 are interconnected. The connecting arrows
show that each different part of our lives influences all the others. For example, changes
in our behavior influence how we think and how we feel (both physically and emotionally). Our behavior can also change our environment and life events. Likewise, changes
in our thinking affect our behavior, moods, and physical reactions, and can lead to
changes in our environment. Understanding how these five parts of our lives interact
can help us understand our problems.
Ben could see how each of these five parts of his experience influenced the other
four, pulling him deeper into his sad mood. For example, as a result of thinking, “All
my friends will die soon because we’re getting old” (thought), Ben stopped calling them
on the phone (behavior). As Ben became more isolated from his friends, he began to feel
lonely and sad (mood), and his inactivity contributed to his sleep problems and tiredness
(physical reactions). Since he no longer called his friends or did things with them, many
of them stopped calling him (environment). Over time, these interacting forces dragged
Ben into a downward spiral of depression.
At first, when Ben and his therapist recognized this pattern, Ben was discouraged:
“It’s hopeless, then – each of these things will just get worse and worse until I die!” His
therapist suggested the possibility that since each of these five areas was connected to the
other four, small improvements in any of the areas could contribute to positive change
in the others. Ben agreed to experiment to figure out what small changes would make
him feel better.
Ben is one of four people described in this chapter whom we follow throughout this
book. These four people were experiencing difficulties that are often helped by the strategies and methods described in Mind Over Mood. To protect confidentiality, identifying
information has been changed, and the descriptive information is a composite of several

clients. However, their situations and progress are consistent with our experiences as
therapists helping people with these types of problems.
Linda: My life would be great if I didn’t have panic attacks!
“One of my friends told me cognitive-behavioral therapy can stop panic attacks. Do
you think it would help me?” The phone caller was very direct in her questioning. Her
voice was firm and confident as she quizzed the therapist about CBT. She was equally
direct in describing her recent experiences that prompted her call. “My name is Linda.
I’m 29 years old, and except for a fear of flying in airplanes, I’ve never had any problems I
couldn’t handle myself. I’m a marketing supervisor for a company and have always loved
my job – until two months ago, that is. Two months ago I was promoted to regional
supervisor. Now I need to fly a lot, and I find myself breaking into cold sweats whenever
I think about getting on an airplane. I was thinking of going back to my old job when
my friend told me to call you first. Can you help me?”
Linda arrived early for her first appointment with her briefcase and a notebook,
ready to begin learning what to do. She had been afraid of flying her entire life – a fear
she suspected she’d learned from her mother, who always avoided airplanes. Linda’s
panic attacks had begun eight months ago, before her job promotion.
Linda recalled that her first panic attack happened in a grocery store, when she
noticed her heart pounding during her Saturday shopping. She couldn’t understand why
this was happening and became frightened. This was the first time she broke into a sweat
from fear. At the time she thought she was having a heart attack, so she went to the hospital emergency room. After a series of tests, a doctor assured her that she had not had a
heart attack and was in good health.
Linda continued to have panic attacks once or twice a month until her recent job
promotion. Since her promotion, she had been gripped by fear several times a week. Her
heart raced, she broke into a sweat, and she had difficulty breathing. In addition to when
she was on an airplane, the panicky feeling sometimes just came “out of the blue – even
at home.” Her panic would last for a few minutes and then disappear almost as fast as it
came. She would feel “on edge” for a few hours afterward.
“I support myself. I have good friends and a supportive family. I don’t drink or use
drugs. I’ve always lived a good life. Why is this happening to me?” Linda had in fact led
a happy, hard-working, and balanced life. Her only major trauma had been the death of
her father a year earlier. She missed him terribly, yet took comfort from her relationship
with her mother and two brothers, who lived nearby. Although her job required hard
work, Linda seemed to enjoy the pressure, even though she worried a lot about her performance and what others thought of her.
Why was Linda suffering from panic attacks? Throughout this book, we follow
Linda’s progress in learning to understand her panic attacks. By learning more about
the connections among her physical reactions, thoughts, and behaviors, Linda not only
learned to overcome her panic and manage her worry, but she also became a relaxed
frequent flyer.
Understanding Your Problems 9
Understanding Linda’s Problems
Linda had panic attacks, worries, and also a fear of flying in airplanes – all anxietyrelated problems. Can the model in Figure 2.1 be used to understand anxiety? Notice
how the five areas summarize Linda’s experiences:
Environment/life changes/situations: My father’s death; job promotion.
Physical reactions: Cold sweats; racing heart; difficulty breathing; jumpy.
Moods: Fearful; nervous; panicky.
Behaviors: Avoiding flying; thinking of giving up job promotion.
Thoughts: “I’m having a heart attack,” “I’m dying,” “What if things go wrong and I
can’t cope?,” “Something bad will happen if I fly.”
As you can see, the five-part model describes anxiety as well as it does depression.
Notice some of the differences between anxiety and depression. With depression, physical changes often involve a slowing down – trouble sleeping and feeling tired. Anxiety is
usually marked by a speeding up of physical reactions – racing heart, increased sweating,
feeling jumpy. With depression, the main behavioral change is that people find it difficult to do things, and so they do less and often withdraw from people. Linda described
enjoying people and her job, but she avoided specific things that made her anxious.
When we are anxious, avoidance is the most common change in our behavior.
Finally, thinking is also quite different in depression and anxiety. Ben’s thoughts
illustrated depressed thinking, which tends to be negative, hopeless, and self-critical.
Linda’s thinking was typical of anxiety. It was more catastrophic (“I’m having a heart
attack”) and involved worry about specific future events (an airplane flight) as well as
general worry (“What if things go wrong and I can’t cope?”). Depressed thoughts often
focus on the past and present, and anxious thoughts focus on the present and future.
Chapters 13, 14, and 15 further summarize the distinguishing characteristics of different moods. Chapter 13 provides a measure of common depression symptoms (see
p. 190), and Chapter 14 provides a measure of anxiety symptoms (see p. 220).
Marissa: My life isn’t worth living.
Marissa was very depressed. During her first meeting with her therapist, she confided
that she was increasingly upset and was beginning to feel out of control. She said that her
depression had become worse over the previous six months. This depression frightened
her, because she had been seriously depressed twice before – once when she was 18 years
old, and again at age 25 – and had made suicide attempts both times. With tears in her
eyes, she rolled up her sleeve and showed the scars on her wrist from her first suicide
attempt.
10 Mind Over Mood
Marissa had been sexually molested by her father between the ages of 6 and 14.
When she was 14, her parents divorced. By this time, Marissa already thought of herself
negatively: “I decided I must be bad for my father to hurt me like he did. I was afraid to
get close to other kids, because if they knew what had happened to me, they would think
I was a monster. I was also afraid of adults, because I thought they would hurt me too.”
Marissa grabbed her first chance to get away from home. She agreed to marry her
first boyfriend, Carl. She and Carl were married at age 17 when she became pregnant,
and they divorced three years later, shortly after the birth of her second child. Her second
marriage, at age 23, lasted only two years. Both of her husbands drank heavily and were
physically abusive.
Despite being depressed for 18 months following her second divorce, Marissa
emerged from this desperate period in her life feeling stronger. She decided that she
could care for her children better on her own, without either of her ex-husbands. She
began working and supporting her children by herself. She was a loving mother and was
proud of her children. Her older child, now age 19, worked part-time and was a student
at a local college; her younger child was doing well in school.
Now, at age 36, Marissa was an administrative assistant for a manufacturing company. Despite her successes as a working mother, Marissa was self-critical. During her
first meeting with her therapist, she made minimal eye contact, staring at her hands in
her lap. She spoke in a low monotone and did not smile. Her eyes filled with tears on
several occasions as she talked about how “worthless” she was and how bleak her future
looked to her. “I’ve been thinking more and more about killing myself. The kids are old
enough to take care of themselves. My pain will never end. Death is the only way out.”
In response to questions about her life and what made it so painful to her, Marissa
described feeling intense sadness all day long. As her depression had become worse over
the last six months, Marissa found it increasingly difficult to work and concentrate on
her job. She had been given two verbal warnings and a written notice from her supervisor regarding the timeliness, quality, and quantity of her work. She found herself more
and more tired, and less and less motivated.
At home, Marissa just wanted to be left alone. She would not answer the phone or
talk with family or friends. She prepared minimal meals for her children and then closed
herself in her room, watching television until she fell asleep.
At the first meeting, Marissa was not particularly hopeful that CBT would help her,
but she had promised her family physician that she would give it a try. She thought that
CBT was her last hope, and that if this treatment didn’t work, suicide would be her only
remaining option. Needless to say, her therapist was very concerned about Marissa and
wanted to help her begin to feel better as soon as possible. The therapist referred her to
a psychiatrist for a consultation to see if medication might help her, even though she had
been helped only a little bit by antidepressants in the past. Marissa and her therapist also
agreed that she would track her moods and activities for the upcoming week, so they
could see if there was a connection between her mood and what she was doing during
each day.
Understanding Your Problems 11
Understanding Marissa’s Problems
If we use the five-part model in Figure 2.1 to understand Marissa’s depression, we can
see some similarities between Marissa and Ben in thinking patterns, mood, behavior,
and physical experiences. And yet the important life situations contributing to Marissa’s
depression began back in her early childhood.
Below you see how Marissa and her therapist used the five-part model to understand
her depression.
Environment/life changes/situations: My father sexually molested me; both of my husbands were alcoholic and abusive; I’m a single parent of two teenagers; lots of negative feedback from my work supervisor.
Physical reactions: Tired most of the time.
Moods: Depressed.
Behaviors: Difficulty working; I avoid my family and friends; cry easily; cut myself;
I tried to kill myself twice.
Thoughts: “I’m no good,” “I’m a failure,” “I’m never going to get better,” “My life is
hopeless,” “I may as well kill myself.”
Some people may think that Marissa was destined to remain depressed because of
her harsh life experiences. As you will see, this was not true.
Vic: Help me be more perfect.
Vic, a 49-year-old business executive, began therapy three years after he joined Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) to help him stop drinking. Over six feet tall and athletically
built, Vic arrived for his first appointment neatly dressed in a gray pin-striped suit and a
maroon tie. Every part of Vic’s appearance was perfect, from his neatly trimmed hair to
his highly polished shoes.
Despite frequent urges to drink, Vic had remained sober most of the past three years.
His urge to drink was strongest when he felt sad, nervous, or angry. At these times, he
thought, “I can’t stand these feelings. I need a drink to feel better.” His attendance at AA
meetings was irregular, and resisting drinking was still a struggle for him.
Vic was subject to periods of low mood, during which he saw himself as “no good,”
“worthless,” and “a failure.” He was often nervous. During these times, Vic worried
again and again that he would be fired from his job for poor performance, despite
the fact that he consistently received good evaluations. Whenever his phone rang, Vic
expected the caller to be his boss, telling him he had been fired. He was surprised and
relieved each time this did not happen.
Vic also struggled with periodic outbursts of anger. Although they didn’t happen
12 Mind Over Mood
often, these were very destructive, especially in his relationship with his wife, Judy. He
quickly became angry when he felt others were disrespecting him, behaving unfairly,
mistreating him, or when it seemed as if those close to him didn’t care about his feelings.
He contained his anger at work, but when these types of situations happened at home, he
lost his temper very quickly and exploded in an angry rage. These rages were followed
by feelings of intense shame and regret, triggering more thoughts of worthlessness.
Vic described his 25-year battle with alcohol as a result of lifelong feelings of inadequacy, low self-esteem, and a sense that something “awful” was going to happen to
him. When he drank he felt better, stronger, and “in control.” Becoming sober put the
spotlight on his deep feelings of worthlessness, anxiety, and poor self-esteem, which the
alcohol had covered up.
Early in therapy, it became clear that Vic was a perfectionist. He had been told by his
parents, “If you make a mistake, it’s bad,” and “If you’re going to do something at all, do
it right.” Vic had concluded, “If I’m not perfect, then I’m a failure.”
Vic had grown up with one older brother, Doug, who was a star athlete and straightA student. As a child, Vic felt that his parents’ approval, love, and affection depended on
his performance. Although his parents showed their love for Vic in many ways, he never
felt that they were as proud of him as they were of Doug. He felt pressured to be the
best in school and sports. One year he scored in a big football game, yet Vic was disappointed because a teammate scored twice in the same game. A good performance was
not enough for Vic if it was not also the best.
As an adult, Vic found it harder and harder to be the best. He juggled the roles of
husband, father, and marketing executive, judging his worth by his performance in each
of these areas. He rarely felt perfect in any area of his life and constantly worried about
how other people evaluated him. If he worked long hours at the office to please his boss,
he worried on the drive home that he was letting down his wife and children.
Vic came to therapy looking for ways to feel better about himself and wanting to
feel more confident. He also wanted help staying sober. At the end of the first session,
he told the therapist, with a laugh, “Look, all I want is for you to make me perfect, and
then I’ll be happy.” His therapist suggested to Vic that maybe one goal of therapy should
be to help him feel happy with himself as he was, imperfections and all. Vic swallowed
hard. After a moment, he nodded his head.
Understanding Your Problems 13
Understanding Vic’s Problems
Sometimes we have more than one strong mood. Vic was depressed and anxious, and he
also had periodic outbursts of anger. When Vic and his therapist filled out his five-part
model, there were some similarities with Ben and Marissa (depression) and also with
Linda (anxiety).
Environment/life changes/situations: Mostly sober for three years; lifelong pressure (by
parents and myself) to be the best.
Physical reactions: Difficulty sleeping; stomach problems.
Moods: Nervous; depressed; angry; stressed.
Behaviors: Struggling with urges to drink; sometimes I avoid AA meetings; I try to
do everything perfectly.
Thoughts: “I’m no good,” “I’m worthless,” “I’m a failure,” “I’ll be fired,” “I’m inadequate,” “Something awful will happen,” “If I make a mistake, I’m no good,” “If
someone criticizes me, they are putting me down.”
Vic’s thinking was negative and self-critical (typical of depression) and also involved
worry, self-doubt, and catastrophic predictions (typical of anxiety). In addition, his
thoughts included themes of fairness, disrespect, and being mistreated by others (typical
of anger). Difficulty sleeping and stomach problems can be signs of depression, anxiety,
or even reactions to anger and stress. Of the three moods, anxiety bothered Vic most
often. Like Linda, Vic avoided only particular situations in his life that were connected
with his anxiety. As you recall, Ben and Marissa avoided many situations because they
were depressed.

Exercise: Understanding Your Own Problems
Just as Ben, Marissa, Linda, and Vic used the five-part model to understand their problems, you
can begin to understand your own problems by noticing what you are experiencing in these five
areas of your life: environment/life changes/situations, physical reactions, moods, behaviors, and
thoughts. On Worksheet 2.1, describe any recent changes or long-term problems in each of these
areas. If you have difficulty filling out Worksheet 2.1, ask yourself the questions in the Helpful Hints

Can you see some connections among the five parts on Worksheet 2.1? For example,
do your thoughts and moods seem connected? Did changes in your environment or life
situations lead to any changes in the other four parts? Do your behaviors seem connected
to your moods or thoughts? For many people, these five areas are connected. The good
news is that because this is so, small positive changes in one area can lead to positive
changes in all the other areas as well. In therapy, we look for the smallest changes that
can lead to the biggest overall positive improvement. As you use this book, notice what
small changes help you feel better. While small changes in several areas may be necessary
for you to feel better, changes in your thinking or behavior are often important if you
want to create lasting positive improvements in your life. The next few chapters help
explain why this is so.

If you are having trouble fi lling out Worksheet 2.1, you might fi nd it
helpful to look again at the fi ve-part models fi lled out by Linda,
Marissa, and Vic. Then ask yourself the following questions:
Environment/life changes/situations: What recent changes have there
been in my life (positive as well as negative)? What have been the
most stressful events for me in the past year? Three years? Five years?
In childhood? Do I experience any long-term or ongoing challenges
(e.g., discrimination or harassment by others, physical/health challenges for me or family members, ongoing fi nancial problems)?
Physical reactions: What physical symptoms am I having? (Consider
general changes in energy level, appetite, pain levels, and sleep, as
well as occasional symptoms such as muscle tension, tiredness, rapid
heartbeat, stomachaches, sweating, dizziness, and breathing diffi culties.)
Moods: What single words describe my most frequent or troubling
moods (sad, nervous, angry, guilty, ashamed)?
Behaviors: What behaviors are connected to my moods? At work? At
home? With friends? By myself? (Behaviors are the things we do or
avoid doing. For example, Linda avoided airplanes, Vic tried to be
perfect, and Ben stopped doing things.)
Thoughts: When I have strong moods, what thoughts do I have about
myself? Other people? My future? What thoughts interfere with
doing the things I would like to do or think I should do? What
images or memories come into my mind?

reactions, moods, behaviors, and thoughts.
X Each of these fi ve parts interacts with the others.
X Small changes in any one area can lead to changes in the other areas.
X Identifying these fi ve parts may give you a new way of understanding your own
problems and give you some ideas for how to make positive changes in your life

It’s the Thought That Counts
I
n Chapter 2, you learned how thinking, mood, behavior, physical reactions, and environment/life situations all affect each other. In this chapter, you learn that when you
want to feel better, your thoughts are often the place to start. This chapter describes how
learning more about your thoughts can help you in many areas of your life.
What Is the Thought–Mood Connection?
Whenever we experience a mood, there is a thought connected to it
that helps define the mood. For example, suppose you are at a party,
and a friend introduces you to Alex. As you talk, Alex never looks at
you; in fact, throughout your brief conversation, he looks over your
shoulder across the room. Following are three different thoughts
you might have in this situation. Four moods are listed below each thought. Mark the
mood that you believe you would have with each thought:
Thought: Alex is rude. He is insulting me by ignoring me.
Possible moods (mark one):  Irritated  Sad  Nervous  Caring
Thought: Alex doesn’t find me interesting. I bore everybody.
Possible moods (mark one):  Irritated  Sad  Nervous  Caring
Thought: Alex seems shy. He’s probably too uncomfortable to look at me.
Possible moods (mark one):  Irritated  Sad  Nervous  Caring
This example illustrates that the moods we experience often depend upon our thoughts.
Different interpretations of an event can lead to different moods. Since moods are often

Thoughts
 It’s the Thought That Counts 17
distressing or may lead to behavior with consequences (such as telling Alex he is rude),
it is important to identify what you are thinking and to check out the accuracy of your
thoughts before acting. For instance, if Alex is shy, it would be inaccurate to think of
him as rude, and you may regret it later if you respond with anger or irritation.
Even situations you might think would create the same mood for everyone – such as
losing a job – may, in fact, lead to different moods because of different personal beliefs
and meanings. For example, one person facing a job loss might think, “I’m a failure,”
and feel depressed. Another person might think, “They have no right to fire me; this is
discrimination,” and feel angry. A third person might think, “I don’t like this, but now
is my chance to try out a new job,” and feel a mixture of nervousness and anticipation.
Thoughts help determine which mood we experience in a given situation. Once a
mood is present, we often begin thinking additional thoughts that support and strengthen
the mood. For example, angry people think about ways they have been hurt, depressed
people think about all the negative aspects of their lives, and anxious people think about
danger. This does not mean that our thinking is wrong when we experience an intense
mood. But when we feel intense moods, we are more likely to distort, discount, or disregard information that contradicts the validity of our moods and beliefs. In fact, the
stronger our moods, the more extreme our thinking is likely to be.
For example, if we are mildly anxious before a party, we might have a thought:
“I won’t know what to say when I meet new people, and I’ll feel really awkward.”
However, if we are highly anxious, our thought may be “I won’t know what to say. I’ll
blush as red as a beet, and I’ll make a complete fool of myself.” In addition, we won’t
remember in this moment that we have been to many parties before, and usually we do
think of something to say to new people and generally have a good time. All of us think
like this sometimes. This is why it is helpful to be aware of our thoughts when we are
most distressed. When we are aware of our thoughts, we more easily see how they are
influencing our mood. The following example shows how Marissa’s thinking makes her
depression worse.
Marissa: The thought–mood connection.
Marissa thought she was unlovable. This belief seemed absolutely true to her. Given her
negative experiences with men, she couldn’t even imagine that someone could truly love
her. This belief, coupled with her desire to be in a relationship, led her to feel depressed.
When a colleague, Julio, began to be attracted to her, she had the following experiences:
• A friend teased her about the frequent phone calls she received at work from Julio,
saying, “I think you have an admirer, Marissa!” Marissa replied, “What do you
mean? He doesn’t call that often.” (Not noticing positive information)
• Julio complimented Marissa, and she thought, “He is just saying this to keep up a
good work relationship.” (Discounting positive information)
• When Julio asked to meet her for lunch, Marissa thought, “I’m probably explain-
18 Mind Over Mood
ing the work project so poorly that he resents the extra time the project is taking.”
(Jumping to a negative conclusion)
• At lunch, Julio told Marissa he thought that they had both been very creative
on the project, and said he had really enjoyed spending the extra time with her.
He went on to tell her that he found her attractive. Marissa thought, “Oh, he
probably says that to everyone and doesn’t really mean it.” (Discounting positive
experiences)
Since Marissa was convinced that she was unlovable, she ignored or distorted information that was not consistent with her belief. Because she was very depressed, she had
trouble believing the positive things people said that could help her feel better. Ignoring
information that doesn’t fit with our beliefs is something we can learn to change. For
Marissa, learning to take in positive information about her attractiveness and lovability
could be the start of something wonderful.
What Is the Thought–Behavior Connection?
Our thoughts and behaviors are usually closely connected. For example, we
are more likely to try to do something if we believe it is possible. For many
years, athletes believed it was impossible to run a four-minute mile. In track
events around the world, top runners ran a mile in just over four minutes.
Then a British miler, Roger Bannister, identified changes he could make in
his running style and strategy to break the four-minute barrier. He believed
it was possible to run faster and put many months of effort into changing his
running technique to reach this goal. In 1954, Roger Bannister became the first man
to run a mile in less than four minutes. His belief that he could succeed contributed to
behavior change.
Remarkably, once Bannister broke the record, the best milers from around the
world also began to run the mile in under four minutes. Unlike Bannister, these runners
had not substantially changed their running techniques. What had changed were their
beliefs; they now thought it was possible to run this fast, and their behavior followed this
thought. Of course, just knowing it is possible to run fast does not mean that everyone
can do this. Thinking is not the same as doing. But the more strongly we believe that
something is possible, the more likely we are to attempt it and maybe succeed at it.
On a daily basis, we all have “automatic thoughts” that influence our behavior.
These are the words and images that pop into our heads throughout the day. For example, imagine that you are at a family reunion. The food has just been laid out, and some
family members go over to the buffet tables to fill their plates, while others remain seated
and talking. You have been talking with your cousin for 10 minutes. Consider each of
the following thoughts and write what behavior you would probably do if you had this
thought.

wonderful conversation – I’ve never met
anyone so interesting.                    
Did your behavior change, depending on the thought you had?
Sometimes we are not aware of the thoughts that affect our behavior. Thoughts
often occur rapidly, automatically, and just out of our awareness. We sometimes act
out of habit, and the original thoughts that led to these habits have been forgotten. For
example, perhaps we always give in when someone disagrees with us. This habit may
have started with a belief such as “If we disagree, then it is best to just let it go, because
otherwise our relationship won’t last.” We often are not aware of the thoughts guiding
our behavior when our actions have become routine. An example from Ben’s life illustrates the thought–behavior connection.
Ben: The thought–behavior connection.
After his friend Louie died, Ben cut back on meeting his friends for lunch and other
activities he used to enjoy. At first, his family thought that avoiding his friends was part
of Ben’s grief over Louie’s death. But as the months passed and Ben still refused to get
together with friends, his wife, Sylvie, began to suspect there might be other reasons Ben
was staying at home.
One morning, Sylvie sat down with Ben and asked him why he was not returning
his friends’ telephone calls. Ben shrugged and said, “What’s the point? We’re at that age
where we’re all just dying anyhow.” Sylvie felt exasperated. “But you’re alive now – do
the things you enjoy!” Ben shook his head and thought, “Sylvie just doesn’t understand.”
Sylvie really didn’t understand, because Ben was not aware of the thoughts guiding
his behavior, and he couldn’t fully explain to her why he had stopped doing activities he
used to enjoy. As Ben learned to identify his thoughts, he realized that he had a series
of thoughts: “Everyone is dying. What’s the use in doing things when I’m just going to
lose everyone anyhow? If I don’t feel like doing something, then I won’t enjoy myself.”
20 Mind Over Mood
When Louie died, Ben decided he had reached the age where death was close at hand.
This awareness influenced his thoughts and his willingness to do the things he used to
enjoy.
By contrast, Sylvie, who was only a little younger than Ben, thought she should do
as many enjoyable activities as possible and enjoy life to the fullest. She frequently saw
her friends and stayed quite active. As you can see, Sylvie’s and Ben’s different thoughts
about growing older had a big impact on their behavior.
What Is the Thought–Physical Reactions Connection?
Thoughts also affect our physical reactions. Think about watching a really good movie.
When you watch movies, you often anticipate what is coming next. If you think something scary or violent is about to happen, your body reacts as well. Your heart might start
to beat more rapidly, and your breathing may actually change as your muscles get tight.
If you anticipate a romantic scene, your body may feel warm or even sexually aroused.
Athletes are trained to use the powerful link between thoughts
and physical reactions. Good coaches give their teams inspirational
speeches, which they hope will “fire up” the team members, get
adrenalin flowing, and lead to top performance. Olympic athletes
are often taught to imagine in detail their performance in an event.
Research shows that athletes who do this type of vivid imagining actually experience
small muscle contractions that reflect the bigger muscle movements they make in their
event. This thought–muscle connection improves the athlete’s performance.
Research has also discovered that our thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes have an impact
on our health. For example, you have probably heard that many medications and health
treatments benefit from the “placebo effect.” What this means is that our expectation
that a medication or treatment will help, increases the likelihood that it does help: Our
belief that a pill will help us can itself lead to improvement, even if the pill is just a sugar
pill. Modern brain research has found that the placebo effect comes about partly because
our beliefs are a type of brain activity and can lead to real changes in physical responses.
Linda: The thought–physical reactions connection.
Just as our thoughts affect our physical reactions, our physical reactions can trigger
thoughts. For example, after climbing up a set of stairs, Linda noticed that her heart was
beating faster. Because Linda worried about her heart, when her heart rate went up, she
had the thought “I’m having a heart attack” (Figure 3.1). This terrifying thought put her
whole body on alert, and she experienced a series of physical changes, including quick,
shallow breathing and profuse sweating. As Linda’s breathing became shallower, she
took in less oxygen, which caused her heart to beat even faster. Her brain also temporarily received less oxygen, which caused a sensation of dizziness and light-headedness.
Linda’s thought that she was having a heart attack increased her physical reactions

Thoughts
 It’s the Thought That Counts 21
and led her to believe she was in immediate danger of dying. Her physical responses to
the idea that she was dying intensified until Linda experienced a full-blown panic attack.
After a while, Linda realized that she was not having a heart attack. As she began to
think this way, her physical symptoms gradually disappeared.
What Is the Thought–Environment Connection?
At the beginning of this chapter, you learned how
thoughts influence the moods we experience. You may
be wondering why some people are more prone to certain thoughts and moods rather than others. Some portion of these differences may be
biological or genetically inherited. But we also know that our environment and life
experiences can powerfully shape the beliefs and moods that color our lives. We use the
words “environment” and “life experiences” to describe anything outside of us, including our families, our communities, the places we live, interactions with other people,
and even our culture. We can be influenced by both present and past experiences that
stretch over time from our childhoods to this moment.
Recall that Marissa was sexually and physically abused throughout her childhood
and early adult years. These experiences shaped her beliefs that she was worthless, unacceptable, and unlovable, and that men were dangerous, abusive, and uncaring. It is
understandable that Marissa’s earliest attempts to make sense of her experiences led her
to devalue herself and be on the lookout for the negative reactions of others.
It doesn’t take traumatic environmental events to influence beliefs. The way we
think about ourselves and our lives is influenced by culture, family, neighborhood, gender, religion, and the mass media. As an example of how culture influences beliefs, consider the messages we are given as children. In many cultures, girls are complimented
for being pretty, and boys are rewarded for being strong and athletic. A girl might conclude that being pretty is the key to being well liked, and she might value herself for her

appearance only. A boy might believe that he should be strong and athletic, and similarly
judge himself on his athletic success or failure.
There is nothing inherently more likable about beauty or strength, but some cultures teach us to make these connections. Once these beliefs are formed, they can be
difficult to change. Therefore, many girls who are athletic find it difficult to value their
skills, and boys with musical or artistic talents but no strong athletic skills may feel
cursed rather than blessed.
Vic was raised in a suburban community of educated professionals who valued
achievement for themselves and their children. His family and school reflected these
community values, emphasizing achievement and excellence. When Vic’s performance
in school or on the athletic field was not superior, his family, teachers, and friends were
disappointed and reacted as if Vic had failed.
From these reactions, Vic concluded that he was inadequate, even though his performance was generally very good. Since Vic believed he was inadequate, it is not surprising that he felt anxious in situations that required him to perform. He dreaded athletic
events because there was a risk that he would not win or perform well. To him, those
outcomes would mean that he was inadequate.
As you can see, Vic’s childhood was not as traumatic as Marissa’s. However, the
environment he grew up in had a powerful impact on his thoughts that persisted into
adulthood.
Exercise: The Thought Connections
Worksheet 3.1 provides practice in recognizing the connections between thoughts and mood,
behavior, and physical reactions.
Worksheet 3.1. The Thought Connections
Sarah, a 34-year-old woman, sat in the back row of the auditorium during a school meeting for parents. She had
concerns and questions regarding how her 8-year-old son was being taught, as well as questions about classroom security. As Sarah was about to raise her hand to voice her concerns and questions, she thought, “What if
other people think my questions are stupid? Maybe I shouldn’t ask these questions in front of the whole group.
Someone may disagree with me and this could lead to a public argument. I could be humiliated.”
Thought–Mood Connection
Based on Sarah’s thoughts, which of the following moods is she likely to experience? (Mark all that apply.)

 2. Sadness
 3. Happiness

Based on Sarah’s thoughts, how do you predict she will behave?
 1. She will speak loudly and voice her concerns.
 2. She will remain silent.
 3. She will openly disagree with what other people say.
Thought–Physical Reactions Connection
Based on Sarah’s thoughts, which of the following physical changes might she notice? (Mark all that apply.)
 1. Rapid heart rate
 2. Sweaty palms
 3. Breathing changes
 4. Dizziness

When Sarah had these thoughts, she felt anxious and nervous, remained silent, and
experienced a rapid heart rate, sweaty palms, and breathing changes. Were these the
reactions you anticipated Sarah would have? Not everyone experiences the same reactions to particular thoughts. However, it is important to recognize that thoughts influence our mood, behavior, and physical reactions.
Is Positive Thinking the Solution?
Although our thoughts affect our moods, behavior, and physical reactions, positive
thinking is not a solution to life’s problems. Most people who are anxious, depressed, or
angry can tell you that “just thinking positive thoughts” is not that easy. In fact, thinking only positive thoughts is overly simplistic, usually does not lead to lasting change,
and can lead us to overlook information that might be important.
Mind Over Mood instead teaches you to consider all information and many different angles on a problem. Looking at a situation from all sides and considering a wide
range of information – positive, negative, and neutral – can lead to more helpful ways of
understanding things and new solutions to difficulties you face.
If Linda was planning a business trip that required her to fly on an airplane, simply
thinking positive thoughts, such as “I won’t have a panic attack. Everything will be fine,”
would not prepare her for the anxiety she might feel. In fact, with positive thinking,
Linda might feel like a failure if she felt even a small amount of anxiety. A better solution
for Linda would be to anticipate that she might feel anxious and to have a plan for how
she will cope with her anxiety in flight. If we only think about the positive, we may not
be able to accurately predict and cope with events that are worse than we expect.
24 Mind Over Mood
Is Changing the Way You Think the Only Way
to Feel Better?
Even though the process of identifying, testing, and considering alternative thoughts is a
central part of CBT and Mind Over Mood, it is often equally important to make changes
in your physical reactions and/or your behavior. For example, if you have been anxious for a long time, you probably avoid things that make you anxious. Part of dealing
with anxiety may be accepting your anxiety (cognitive shift), learning to relax (physical
change), and approaching what frightens you so you can learn to cope with it (behavioral change). People do not usually overcome anxiety until they change their thoughts
and overcome avoidance.
Making changes in your environment/life situations can also help you feel better.
Reducing stress, learning to say no to unreasonable demands made by others, spending
more time with supportive people, working with neighbors to increase neighborhood
safety, and taking action to reduce discrimination or harassment on the job are all environmental/life changes that can help you feel better.
Some life situations are so challenging that simply thinking differently about things
is not a wise idea. For example, someone who is being abused needs help either to
change or to leave the situation. Just changing thoughts is not an adequate solution for
abuse: The goal is to stop the abuse. Thought changes might help someone in this situation feel motivated to get help, but simply changing thoughts to permit acceptance of
abuse is not a helpful solution.
As you complete the worksheets in this book, you will learn how to identify and
change your thoughts, moods, behaviors, physical responses, and environment/life situations.

Identifying and Rating Moods
I
n order to learn to understand and improve your moods, it is helpful to identify the
moods you are experiencing. Moods can be difficult to name. You may feel tired all the
time and not recognize that you are depressed. Or you may feel nervous and out of control and not recognize that you are anxious. Along with depression and anxiety, anger,
shame, and guilt are very common moods that can be troubling (see Chapters 13–15).
Identifying Moods
The list in the box below shows a variety of moods you may experience. This is not a
comprehensive list. You can write additional moods on the blank lines. This list helps
you name your moods more specifically than simply “bad” or “good.” Notice that
moods are usually described by one word. When you identify specific moods, you can
set goals to improve your moods and track your progress. Learning to distinguish among
moods can help you choose actions designed to improve particular moods. For example,
certain breathing techniques help nervousness but not depression.

26 Mind Over Mood
If you have trouble identifying your moods, pay attention to your body. Tight shoulders can be a sign that you are afraid or irritated; heaviness throughout your body may
mean that you feel depressed or disappointed. Identifying your physical reactions can
provide clues to what moods you are feeling.
A second way of getting better at identifying your moods is to pay close attention.
See if you can notice three different moods during a day. Or you can choose some of
the moods from the list in the box on the previous page and write down situations from
your past in which you felt each one. Another strategy is to identify a recent situation in
which you had a strong emotional reaction and mark the moods in the list on the previous page that you felt.
When Vic first began therapy, he knew he was feeling anxious and depressed. As
he learned to identify moods, he discovered that he was also frequently angry. This was
helpful information for Vic, because he was able to learn what was making him angry
and set therapy goals to address those issues. Although he had been mostly sober for three
years, he reported that he felt the urge to drink whenever he feared he was about to get
“out of control.” When he and his therapist looked closely at situations when Vic felt
“out of control,” it became apparent that at these times he was feeling very nervous or
angry. When nervous or angry, Vic experienced a rapid heartbeat, sweaty hands, and a
sense that something terrible was going to happen. He labeled these sensations as being
“out of control,” and he would then have the urge to drink because he thought alcohol
would help him regain control.
Vic tended not to be very specific about his mood, often saying that he was “uncomfortable” or “numb.” When Vic learned that his primary emotional difficulties were
with anger and anxiety, he began to focus his attention on the situations in which he felt
angry or anxious. He learned to distinguish his irritable anger from the fearful worry
of his anxiety. He began to identify these moods, instead of lumping them together as
“numbness.” As Vic became more specific about what he was feeling, it became apparent
to him that when his mood was anxious, he was thinking, “I’m losing control.” When his
mood was angry, he was thinking, “This is not fair – I deserve more respect.” Learning
which moods he was experiencing was an important step toward a better understanding
of his reactions.
It is easy to confuse moods with thoughts. At the beginning of therapy, when Ben’s
therapist asked him what he was feeling (mood), he would reply, “I feel like I want to be
alone.” As Ben began to closely analyze the situations in which he wanted to be alone,
he discovered that he would often be thinking that others (family members or friends) did
not need him or want to be with him. He also realized that he was predicting (thinking) that if he got together with other people, he would not have a good time. As he was
thinking, “They don’t want to be with me,” and “If I go there, I’m not going to enjoy
 identifying and rating Moods 27
myself,” he recognized that his mood was sad. The thought “I feel like I want to be
alone” was connected to Ben’s sad mood. Part of developing the ability to identify your
moods is learning to distinguish your moods from your thoughts.
It is also important to distinguish moods and thoughts from behaviors and from situational factors (aspects of the environment). Behaviors and situational factors can often
be identifi ed by answering the following questions:
1. Who was I with? (situation)
2. What was I doing? (behavior)
3. When did it happen? (situation)
4. Where was I? (situation)
As a general rule, moods can be identifi ed in one word. If you are feeling multiple
moods in a situation, you will use one word to describe each mood. For example, you
might be “sad, scared, and embarrassed” in one situation. Each of these three moods is
described in a single word. If it takes you more than one word to describe a single mood,
you may be describing a thought. Thoughts are the words or images, including memories, that go through your mind.
It is helpful to learn to tell the differences among thoughts, moods, behaviors, physical reactions, and situational factors. By doing this, you can begin to fi gure out which
parts of your experience can be changed to help make your life better.
• Situations and behaviors can be described by asking yourself:
Who?
What?
When?
Where?
• Moods can be described by one word.
• Thoughts are the words, images, and memories that go through
your mind.

Exercise: Identifying Moods
One step in learning to feel better is to learn to identify different parts of your experiences –
situations, behaviors, moods, physical reactions, and thoughts. Worksheet 4.1 is designed to help
you learn to separate your moods from the situations you are in. In order to complete this worksheet, focus on specific situations in which you had a strong mood.
Worksheet 4.1. Identifying Moods
Describe a recent situation in which you had a strong mood. Next, identify what moods you had during or
immediately after being in that situation. Do this for five different situations.

One of Vic’s responses on Worksheet 4.1 looked like this:
Situation: I’m alone, driving in my car, on the way to work at 7:45 a.m.
Moods: Frightened, anxious, insecure.
 identifying and rating Moods 29
One of Ben’s responses was the following:
Situation: I received a phone call from Max asking me to lunch.
Moods: Sadness, grief.
As these examples illustrate, knowing the situation does not always help us understand why someone felt a particular emotion. Why would a lunch invitation make Ben
feel sad? The presence of strong moods is our fi rst clue that something important is happening. Later chapters teach you why Ben and Vic – and you – experienced the particular moods described on Worksheet 4.1.
RATING MOODS
In addition to identifying moods, it is important to learn to rate the intensity of the
moods you experience. Rating the intensity of each mood allows you to observe how
your moods fl uctuate. Rating your moods also helps alert you to which situations or
thoughts are associated with changes in moods. Finally, you can use changes in emotional intensity to evaluate the effectiveness of strategies you are learning.
In order to see how your moods vary, you’ll fi nd it convenient to use a rating scale.
Ben and his therapist developed the following rating scale for his moods:
0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
Not at

A little Medium A lot Most I’ve
ever felt
The therapist then asked Ben to use this scale to rate the moods he listed on Worksheet
4.1. For the lunch invitation, Ben’s ratings looked like this:
Situation: I received a phone call from Max asking me to lunch.
Moods: Sadness, grief.
Sadness 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
Grief 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
These ratings indicate that Ben experienced a high level of grief (90) and a medium level
of sadness (50) while on the phone with Max.

 Identifying and Rating Moods 31
Many people find it helpful to measure their moods weekly or at least twice a month.
If you are experiencing depression (unhappiness) and/or anxiety (nervousness), you can
use the Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory (Worksheet 13.1, p. 191) and the Mind
Over Mood Anxiety Inventory (Worksheet 14.1, p. 221) to measure these moods. For
other moods, you can use Measuring and Tracking My Moods (Worksheet 15.1, p. 253).
Once you have measured your moods, mark your score(s) on the relevant worksheet(s).
For depression, use Worksheet 13.2 (p. 192); for anxiety, use Worksheet 14.2 (p. 222);
and for other moods, use Worksheet 15.2 (p. 254).
Take a few moments right now to fill out the mood measures that apply to the
moods you want to improve. It is really helpful to make this first measurement before
you begin to read other chapters in this book, so you have a record of where you started.
As you use Mind Over Mood, you may also find it helpful to track changes in your
positive moods. Use Worksheet 15.1 to rate your happiness over the past week. You can
use a copy of Worksheet 15.2 in the Appendix to track your happiness scores if you are
already using Worksheet 15.2 on page 254 to track changes in another mood. Alternatively, you can use different colors on the same worksheet to track different moods.
As you use Mind Over Mood, rate your happiness on Worksheet 15.1 at least once a
month. As you use and practice Mind Over Mood skills, you can measure what impact
these have on your level of happiness.
Tracking changes in your mood scores is one way to know if Mind Over Mood is
helping you. If it is, you will feel distressing moods less often and less intensely and your
overall level of happiness will increase.
What If You Struggle with Multiple Moods?
It is quite common to struggle with many different moods. Our emotional lives can be
complicated. The good news is that Mind Over Mood skills are fundamental to helping
all mood issues. All the skills you learn can help with a variety of moods. To get the fastest results when you struggle with multiple moods, we recommend you choose the one
mood that is most distressing and read that chapter first (see Chapters 13–15). At the end
of that chapter, it will recommend which chapters to read next.
For example, if you are both depressed and anxious, decide which mood you most
want relief from first. If you want to work on depression first, read Chapter 13 and do
the exercises there, and then read the other chapters in this book until your depression
improves. When your depression lifts, begin reading Chapter 14 on anxiety, and then
follow the recommended chapter sequence to reduce your anxiety. It may surprise you
to realize that once you learn skills that help you with depression, these same skills can
be helpful for managing anger, guilt, anxiety, and so forth. Skills that help you manage
these moods will probably also help boost your happiness at the same time.
If a therapist or other professional has recommended this book to you, he or she may
suggest you read the chapters in a different order from the order in the book. There are
many different ways to use Mind Over Mood. While each chapter adds to your knowledge
and abilities, some people will not need to use every chapter to feel better.
32 Mind Over Mood
Now that you have read and done the exercises in these first four chapters, it is a
good time to personalize your use of Mind Over Mood. Rather than going immediately
to Chapter 5, read the chapter next that teaches you about the mood that is most distressing for you:
• Depression: Chapter 13 (p. 188)
• Anxiety and panic: Chapter 14 (p. 219)
• Anger, guilt, or shame: Chapter 15 (p. 252)
Once you finish that chapter and the exercises in it, there will be directions to which
chapter you should read next, so that you can use Mind Over Mood most effectively to
help you feel better as quickly as possible.
Chapter 4 Summary
X Strong moods signal that something important is happening in your life.
X Moods can usually be described in one word.
X Identifying specific moods helps you set goals and track progress.
X It is important to identify the moods you have in particular situations
(Worksheet 4.1).
X Rating your moods (Worksheet 4.2) allows you to evaluate their strength, track
your progress, and evaluate the effectiveness of strategies you are learning.
X Mind Over Mood can be customized to help with the moods that are most
distressing to you. After completing this chapter, go to the recommended mood
chapter pertaining to that mood. At the end of that chapter, additional chapters
and the order in which you should read them are recommended.

Setting Personal Goals
and Noticing Improvement
The Lewis Carroll story Alice in Wonderland describes a moment when Alice, facing a
fork in the road, meets the Cheshire Cat and asks him which road to take. The cat
asks Alice where she is going. Alice, who has never been to Wonderland before, says, “I
don’t much care where –”; the Cheshire Cat happily interrupts, “Then it doesn’t matter
which way you go.” Alice then completes her thought: “– so long as I get somewhere.”
Just as Alice has never been in Wonderland, you may never have learned skills for
managing your moods, and so you don’t know what to expect or where you want to be
by the end of this book. To make the best use of this book, where you are going does
matter. If you know what your goals are, you will have clearer ideas about how to use
this book and track your progress. With a goal in mind, it may also be easier to keep
practicing what you learn, because you have an end in sight.
Think about the reasons why you picked up this book or why someone recommended it to you. How do you hope you might be different as a result of using Mind
Over Mood?
Worksheet 5.1 on the next page asks you to write down your goals so you don’t
forget them and also so you can keep track of your progress as you learn Mind Over Mood
skills. Would you like to be less depressed? Happier? Have fewer panic attacks? Be less
anxious? Improve your relationships? Drink or use drugs less? Go places or do things
you are currently avoiding? Have a greater sense of purpose or meaning? Try to make
your goals as specific as possible and word them in such a way that you can measure your
progress. For example, “improve my relationships” is a good goal, but “having positive and enjoyable conversations with my children more often” is even better because
it is easier to tell if you are making progress toward this more specific goal. The mood
measures throughout this book help you measure mood changes if these are your goals.
34
Exercise: Setting Goals
Write on the lines in Worksheet 5.1 two changes in your moods or life you hope will result from
learning the skills in this book. Each goal you write should be something that you can observe or
measure (such as a mood or behavior change). If you have more than two goals, either fit them on
the lines below or write them on another piece of paper.

photocopy and/or download additional copies of this worksheet (see the box at the end of the table of contents).
Very often people have mixed feelings about making changes in their lives or spending time learning new skills. For example, Anna often felt anxious and sometimes had
panic attacks. She learned that if she stayed home and didn’t go out, she would feel less
anxious. She grew comfortable staying at home; in fact, she arranged with her employer
that she could telecommute most days, so she rarely needed to go out. However, Anna
missed the social activities she used to enjoy. The goals she identified on Worksheet 5.1
were to reduce her anxiety and easily leave home whenever she wanted. These goals had
both advantages (she would be able to do more activities) and disadvantages (she might
have to step outside of her comfort zone).
With a bit more thought, Anna realized that there would be additional advantages
to reducing her anxiety about leaving the house. These included the possibilities that she
could see her friends and family more often, she would be able to go on nature walks like
she used to enjoy, and she would have more career opportunities. When Anna weighed
the advantages and disadvantages of change, she decided that the advantages outweighed
the disadvantages. This increased her motivation to change. She reviewed these advantages and disadvantages periodically, especially when the steps she needed to take were
more challenging. Worksheet 5.2 asks you to consider the advantages and disadvantages
you face if you reach the goals you set above.
35
Exercise: Advantages and Disadvantages
Write the advantages and disadvantages of reaching or not reaching the goals you identified on
Worksheet 5.1 in the boxes on Worksheet 5.2. If you have more than two goals, print out extra
copies of this worksheet.

36 Mind Over Mood
Did you find that there are both advantages and disadvantages of reaching or not
reaching your goals? Are the advantages of reaching your goals and the disadvantages of
not reaching your goals big enough that you feel motivated to learn and practice skills
to help you reach your goals?
Luckily, most people have knowledge, positive qualities, and skills that offer hope
they will be able to reach their goals. For example, when Anna put her mind to something, she generally kept working at it until she succeeded. Her family and friends were
loving and supportive. For most of her life, she had been able to leave her home and live
a life not affected by anxiety. Each of these qualities and circumstances made it more
likely that she would be able to reach her goals of reducing anxiety and panic, as well as
living a life with greater freedom of movement.
Exercise: What Will Help
On the lines in Worksheet 5.3, write some of your qualities, strengths, experiences, and values
that give you hope you can reach your goals. Consider past successes and obstacles you have
overcome; any positive qualities you have, such as a sense of humor or other skills that help you
through difficult times; spiritual beliefs; a willingness to learn new skills; people who support you;
physical health and stamina; or even a single-minded motivation to reach your goals. Write here
anything you can think of that will help you reach the goals you have written in Worksheets 5.1
and 5.2.

You may want to mark these pages so that as you work toward your goals; you can
refer back to the advantages and disadvantages of reaching them (Worksheet 5.2), as well
as the resources you have identified on Worksheet 5.3.
37
 Exercise: Signs of Improvement
In addition to rating your mood, it is helpful to actively look for and notice signs of improvement.
What do you expect might be different as you begin to improve? Indicate on Worksheet 5.4 what
you might notice as you begin to make changes and improve.
Worksheet 5.4. Signs of Improvement
Check any of the following that would be early signs of improvement:
 Sleep better.
 Talk with people more.
 Feel more relaxed.
 Smile more often.
 Get my work done.
 Wake up and get out of bed at a regular time.
 Do activities I currently avoid.
 Handle disagreements better.
 Lose my temper less often.
 Other people tell me I seem better.
 Feel more confident.
 Stand up for myself.
 See hope for the future.
 Enjoy each day more.
 Feel appreciation and gratitude.
 See improvement in relationships.
In addition to what you checked above, write two or three other signs that you could look for to know you are
beginning to improve and getting closer to reaching your goals:

38 Mind Over Mood
It’s helpful to pay attention and notice small signs of improvement as you use Mind
Over Mood. Just as problems you experience can gradually get worse over time, positive
changes often start small and grow into bigger, more meaningful improvements. If you
notice early positive changes, this can encourage you to continue learning and practicing
Mind Over Mood skills.
Chapter 5 Summary
X Setting personal goals for mood or behavior change helps you know where you
are headed and can help you track your progress.
X People often have mixed feelings about making changes, because there are
usually advantages and disadvantages in doing so. Keeping your reasons for
change in mind can help you stay motivated.
X Supportive people in your life, as well as your personal qualities, past
experiences, values, strengths, and motivation to learn new skills, can all offer
hope that you will reach your goals.
X It is important to pay attention and notice the early signs of improvement you
have checked on Worksheet 5.4, because positive changes often start small and
grow bigger over time.

Situations, Moods,
and Thoughts
One warm spring day in central California, a tennis coach was instructing a student
on the art of serving the ball. While the student tossed and hit the ball over and
over again, the coach focused attention on each part of the student’s motion and swing.
The coach never criticized the student, but instead gave feedback after each hit about the
position of the racquet, the height of the ball toss, the angle of the racquet as it hit the
ball, and the student’s motion during the racquet follow-through.
In tennis, the ball needs to land in a service square in order to be a successful hit.
Yet, remarkably, the coach never once looked to see where the ball landed after the
student served it. Instead, the coach focused his feedback exclusively on suggestions for
improving each part of the student’s service stroke. The coach was confident that once
the student learned each of the component skills, the student would be able to combine
them so that the ball would consistently land in the proper area.
Just as this coach focused on development of specific skills, music teachers help students become better musicians by teaching notes, rhythms, and performance methods.
Skilled laborers instruct their apprentices by showing them how to accomplish individual tasks on a work project. Each of these examples involves teaching specific skills and
encouraging the learner to practice until these skills become familiar and easy to perform.
We have all had experience with developing skills through practice (e.g., driving a car,
dressing a baby, cooking a meal).
Fortunately, there is a set of specific skills that you can learn to improve your mood
and make positive changes in your life. Some of these skills are summarized on a sevencolumn worksheet called a “Thought Record” (Figure 6.1). Like the student practicing
a tennis stroke, you will use parts of Thought Records many times in the weeks ahead
to master the skills necessary to complete the whole worksheet.
When Marissa’s therapist first showed her a Thought Record, Marissa felt overwhelmed and depressed. The therapist used this reaction to help Marissa complete her
40 Mind Over Mood
first Thought Record (Figure 6.2, pp. 42–43). Notice that the first two columns of
Marissa’s Thought Record describe the situation she was in and what she was feeling.
You learned to identify situations and moods in Chapter 4. As her therapist helped
Marissa fill out column 3, labeled “Automatic Thoughts (Images),” they uncovered certain thoughts that accompanied her mood reactions.
Marissa and her therapist next circled the thought (“This is too complicated for me
to learn”) that was most strongly connected to her feeling overwhelmed. They wrote
down evidence in columns 4 and 5 that did and did not support this thought. In column
6, they wrote some alternative ways of looking at the situation, based on the evidence
in columns 4 and 5. They rated Marissa’s belief in these alternative views 90%, 60%,

and 70%. As you see in column 7, completing this Thought Record lowered Marissa’s
feeling of being overwhelmed from 95% to 40%, and her depression from 85% to
80%.
The next few chapters teach you how to use the Thought Record as a tool to
improve your own moods. You will learn to uncover your automatic thoughts and
images in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 shows you how to look for evidence for your automatic
thoughts. In Chapter 9, you will learn how to use the evidence you find to construct
more adaptive ways of thinking and viewing your life. The rest of this chapter focuses
on what you need to know to fill out columns 1–3 of the Thought Record, using skills
you have already learned.

In Chapter 4, you learned to describe situations by answering the questions Who? What?
When? Where? In filling out column 1 of the Thought Record, be as specific as possible. Limit the “Situation” description to a specific time frame, from as short as a few
seconds up to 30 minutes. For example, “all day Tuesday” is not specific enough. Even if
you have only one mood “all day Tuesday,” there are too many different situations and
thoughts that can occur during a day to describe on the Thought Record. Researchers
report that we have as many as 50,000 to 70,000 thoughts each day. No one wants to
write that many thoughts on a Thought Record! By narrowing the situation down to a

specific instance in time when our mood is especially strong, you can focus on the most

of her situation as “Tuesday, 9:30 a.m. In my therapist’s office, looking at the Thought

Column 2: Moods
In the “Moods” column of a Thought Record, list the moods you experienced in the situation you described. In addition to listing the moods, rate their intensity on a 0–100 scale.

you are recording should be listed and rated on the 0–100 scale. If you have trouble identifying the mood you were experiencing, you can refer to the Mood List on page 25 for
help. If you describe your mood in an entire sentence, what you wrote may be a thought
instead of a mood. If so, write the sentence in the “Automatic Thoughts (Images)” column
(column 3) and keep looking for a single word to describe your mood in column 2.
People who experience panic attacks or anxiety may also want to record and rate the
physical reactions they experience (see Chapter 14). Since there is not a separate column
for these physical responses, they can be recorded in the bottom half of the “Moods”
column of the Thought Record. Draw a line below the moods you have listed, and write
“Physical reactions” above the line as shown in Figure 6.5 on page 46. Physical reactions
can generally be described in one or two words (e.g., “heart racing 85%”).
COLUMN 3: AUTOMATIC THOUGHTS (IMAGES)
In the “Automatic Thoughts (Images)” column, identify anything that went through
your mind in the situation you have described. Only the thoughts that were actually
present in that situation should be recorded. Thoughts can be either verbal or visual. If
they are images or memories, describe them in words or draw a picture that shows what
went through your mind. Notice that Marissa described one of her thoughts as an image
of bringing home a bad report card (Figure 6.2). Chapter 7 provides more detailed
information to help you become profi cient at identifying your thoughts.
As an example, Marissa brought the Thought Record in Figure 6.3 to her next
therapy session, with the fi rst three columns complete.
A second example shows how Vic reacted to an argument with his wife (Figure 6.4).
Linda’s Thought Record describing one of her fi rst panic attacks, with the fi rst three
columns complete, is shown in Figure 6.5. Notice that she had a number of physical
reactions, which she recorded in the bottom half of column 2.
Ben brought the fi rst three columns of the Thought Record in Figure 6.6 to his
therapist soon after beginning treatment.
• In the “Situation” column of the Thought Record (column 1), write
down the answers to these questions: Who? What? When? Where?
• Moods are identifi ed in one word and rated for intensity on a 0–100%
scale (column 2).
• Physical reactions can be described and rated at the bottom of the
“Moods” column (column 2). This is especially helpful for people with
anxiety, anger, or health concerns.
• The “Automatic Thoughts (Images)” column (column 3) describes
thoughts, beliefs, images, memories, and meanings attached to the situations.

If you had difficulty distinguishing among situations, moods, and thoughts, review
Chapters 3 and 4. By separating these components from each other, you will be better
able to make changes that are important to you. For example, sometimes it is easier to
change a situation or a thought than to change your mood directly.
Chapter 6 Summary
9 Thought Records help develop a set of skills that can improve your moods and
relationships and lead to positive changes in your life.
9 The first three columns of a Thought Record distinguish a situation from the moods,
physical reactions, and thoughts you had in the situation.
9 The Thought Record is a tool that can help you develop new ways of thinking in order
to feel better.
9 As is true whenever you develop a new skill, you will need to practice using the
Thought Record until it becomes a reliable tool to help you feel better.

Automatic Thoughts
Marissa was working at her desk when her supervisor came in to say hello. While they were
talking, her supervisor said, “By the way, I want to compliment you on the nice report you
wrote yesterday.” As soon as her supervisor said this, Marissa became nervous and scared. She
couldn’t shake this mood the rest of the morning.
Vic was putting the dishes on the counter after dinner when his wife said, “I took the car in to
get the oil changed today.” With irritation, Vic said, “I told you I was going to change the oil
on Saturday.” His wife replied, “Well, you’ve been saying you’d take care of it for two weeks,
so I just took care of it myself.” “Fine!” yelled Vic, throwing a dish towel across the room.
“Why don’t you just get yourself another husband!” He grabbed his coat and slammed the door
as he left the house.
As you begin keeping track of your moods, you will notice times when you, like Marissa,
experience a mood that doesn’t seem to fit the situation. Most people don’t feel anxious
after getting a compliment. At other times, you will have a quick, strong reaction like
Vic’s. An outsider looking on this scene might think that Vic was overreacting in this
situation, and yet his reaction might have seemed to be just the right one to him.
How can we make sense of our moods? If we can identify the thoughts we are having, our moods usually make perfect sense. Think of thoughts as clues to understanding
moods. For Marissa, we have the following puzzle:
Situation Clue: Thoughts Mood
My supervisor
compliments me ???
Nervous 80%
Scared 90%
How can this make sense? Marissa was confused about why she reacted this way
until she talked to her therapist.
Automatic Thoughts 51
Therapist: What was scary about this situation?
Marissa: I don’t know – just knowing the supervisor noticed my work, I guess.
Therapist: What’s scary about that?
Marissa: Well, I don’t always do a good job.
Therapist: So what might happen?
Marissa: Someday the supervisor will notice a mistake.
Therapist: And then what might happen?
Marissa: The supervisor will be mad at me.
Therapist: What’s the worst that might happen then?
Marissa: I hadn’t thought about it, but I – I guess I could get fired.
Therapist: That is a scary thought. And then what might happen?
Marissa: With a bad recommendation, I’d have trouble getting another job.
Therapist: So that helps explain why you felt scared. Can you summarize for me
what you’ve figured out here?
Marissa: Maybe the compliment made me realize my supervisor is noticing my
work. I know I make mistakes, so I worried about what might happen if my
supervisor noticed one of these mistakes. I guess I jumped to the conclusion that
I’d be fired and not be able to get another job. It sounds a little silly now.
Notice how the thoughts uncovered by Marissa and her therapist provide the necessary
clues to understand her emotional reaction.
Situation Clue: Thoughts Mood
My supervisor
compliments me
My supervisor is noticing my work. When
my supervisor finds a mistake, I’ll be fired,
and won’t be able to get another job.
Nervous 80%
Scared 90%
Most of us would feel nervous and scared if we thought we were going to be fired and
couldn’t get another job. Now Marissa’s moods make sense. As you can see, an important
step in understanding our moods is learning to identify the thoughts that accompany
them.
See if you can guess what Vic’s automatic thoughts might have been when he got so
angry with his wife for changing the oil in the car.
52 Mind Over Mood
Situation Clue: Thoughts Mood
Judy changed oil in car.
Judy says, “You’ve been saying
you’d take care of it for two
weeks, so I just took care of it
myself.”
Angry 95%
In the “Clue: Thoughts” column, write any thoughts you can think of that would
explain Vic’s strong, angry reaction.
After Vic left the house, he realized that he was not upset that his wife had changed
the oil in the car. In fact, his week had been very busy, and it was a big help that she had
taken care of this chore. His anger was related to the thoughts he had about her changing
the oil. He thought, “She’s mad at me for not doing it. She doesn’t appreciate how hard
I’m trying to do everything. She is critical of me; she thinks I’m not good enough. No
matter how hard I try, she’s never happy with me.”
These thoughts help us understand Vic’s reactions. Thoughts like these are called
“automatic thoughts,” because they simply pop into our heads automatically throughout
the day. We don’t plan or intend to think a certain way. In fact, often we are not even
aware of our automatic thoughts. One of the purposes of CBT is to bring automatic
thoughts into awareness.
Awareness is the first step toward change and better problem solving. Once Vic was
aware of his thoughts, a number of possibilities for change became available to him. If
he decided that his thoughts were distorted or didn’t work for him, he could work to
change his understanding of the situation. On the other hand, if Vic concluded that his
thoughts were accurate, he could talk directly to his wife to discuss his feelings and ask
her to appreciate his efforts more.
How Do We Become Aware of Our Own
Automatic Thoughts?
Since we are constantly thinking and imagining, we have automatic thoughts all the
time. We daydream about friends or the weekend, or worry about getting errands done.
These are all automatic thoughts. When we want to feel better, the automatic thoughts
that are most important are the ones that help us understand our strong moods. These
thoughts can be words (“I’ll be fired”), images or mental pictures (Marissa might have
“seen” herself as a homeless person sitting at a street corner), or memories (the memory of
being hit on the hand with a ruler by her fifth-grade teacher when she made a mistake
might have flashed through Marissa’s mind).

To identify automatic thoughts, notice what goes through your
mind when you have a strong feeling or a strong reaction to
something.
To practice identifying automatic thoughts, write down what goes through your
mind when you imagine yourself in the following situations.
1. situation: You are at a shopping center and are going to buy a very special present for yourself. You saw it there a few weeks ago and have been saving your money to buy it. When you
get to the store, the sales clerk tells you that they no longer carry that item.
automatic thoughts:
2. situation: You cooked a dish for a neighborhood party. You are a bit nervous because you
tried a new recipe. After 10 minutes, several people come up and say they think the food you
made is delicious.
 automatic thoughts:
Different people have different automatic thoughts in these situations. For the food
situation in example 2, some people think, “Oh, good, the food turned out OK,” and
they feel relief or pride. Other people think, “These people are just trying not to hurt
my feelings; it probably tastes terrible,” and they feel ashamed or embarrassed. In any
situation, there are many ways to interpret what events mean. The interpretation you
make affects your mood.
Actually, we usually have a number of automatic thoughts during situations in our
lives. The questions in the following Helpful Hints can help you identify your automatic
54 Mind Over Mood
thoughts. Not every question will help you in every situation, but by asking yourself
these questions, you will capture most of your automatic thoughts. There is a hint after
each question that suggests which questions might be best to help identify automatic
thoughts linked to different moods.

To identify automatic thoughts, ask yourself these questions until you have identifi ed the thoughts that help you understand your emotional reactions. You may need to
ask yourself some of these questions two or three times to uncover all of the automatic
thoughts. To look for images and memories, just let your mind wander and see if any pictures come to mind when you think of the situation in which you had the strong feeling.
You don’t need to answer all of these questions. Sometimes the answers to just one
or two of these questions are enough to identify the thoughts that are going through
your mind when you are having a strong mood. Answer as few, or as many, of the questions in the box as necessary to identify the thoughts associated with your distress.
Begin with General Questions
Usually we start with the fi rst two questions in the Helpful Hints above (the ones labeled
“General”). These are questions you can ask yourself with any mood you experience. In
the beginning, you may not know what went through your mind just before you started
to feel this way. With observation and practice, many people become expert at identifying their key automatic thoughts by just asking the fi rst question in the box.
Automatic Thoughts 55
You might wonder why the second question asks about images and memories. It
turns out that most of us do have images when we are experiencing strong moods. These
may be visual, or a song or words going through our minds, or a physical feeling. Sometimes these images are completely imaginary (e.g., you see yourself lying on the ground
with people staring at you), and sometimes they repeat memories of experiences we have
had (e.g., remembering a day when school classmates laughed at you). When you have
these images or memories, they tend to evoke very strong moods – stronger than those
you experience with word thoughts. So it is very important to notice these images and
memories, and to write them down (or draw them) on a Thought Record along with
other thoughts.
Next, Ask Specific Mood Questions
After asking and answering the general questions, you may find it helpful to ask yourself
the specific mood questions in the Helpful Hints on the facing page. The specific mood
questions are labeled “Anxiety,” “Depression,” “Anger,” “Guilt,” or “Shame.” You are
likely to identify the automatic thoughts associated with each of your moods by asking
these specific questions. You can answer any of these questions that seem helpful to you,
but the specific mood questions are written to help you identify the types of thoughts
that tend to go with particular moods.
Depression
For example, when we feel sad or depressed, we tend to be self-critical and have negative
thoughts about our lives and futures, as described in Chapter 13. Therefore, if you are
experiencing depression or similar moods, like sadness, discouragement, or disappointment, ask yourself, “What does this mean about me?” “What does this mean about my
life?” “What does this mean about my future?” These questions help identify the negative automatic thoughts related to those moods.
Anxiety
Chapter 14 describes how, when we are anxious, we tend to imagine a series of “worstcase” events and outcomes: We overestimate danger and underestimate our ability
to cope with things that go wrong. Sometimes anxious thoughts begin with “What
if . . . ?” and end with a prediction of something terrible happening. When this occurs,
in addition to writing down the “What if . . . ?” question, it is helpful to write down
the answer you give to that question that makes you feel most anxious. For example,
if you think, “What if I have a panic attack at the store?” you might write, “If I have
a panic attack at the store, then I will collapse. I see an image of paramedics coming
and carrying me away. Everyone is staring, and I’m so embarrassed.” Therefore, when
56 Mind Over Mood
you feel anxious, scared, nervous, or similar moods, it is helpful to ask, “What am I
afraid might happen? What is the worst that could happen?” When you are asking
these questions, it can also be helpful to think about what you imagine your own worst
responses might be to the situation (e.g., an image of losing control and running from
the room screaming).
Anger
When we feel angry, resentful, or irritated, our thoughts are generally focused on other
people and how they have harmed or hurt us. We may think (rightly or wrongly) that
others are being unfair, unjust, disrespectful, or are mistreating us in some way. This is
why the Helpful Hints on page 54 recommend asking yourself, “What does this mean
about how the other person(s) feel(s)/think(s) about me?” and “What does this mean
about the other person(s) or people in general?” Chapter 15 teaches more about the
thoughts that commonly accompany anger.
Guilt or Shame
Guilt and shame usually are connected to thoughts about having done something wrong.
Chapter 15 explains these moods in more detail. A variety of thoughts or behaviors may
be associated with feeling guilty or ashamed. For example, you may have let someone
down or believe that you have let the person down. You may have broken a rule or
moral obligation that is important to you, or you may have had thoughts that violate
what you value. Therefore, if your mood is guilt or shame, the Helpful Hints section on
page 54 recommends that you ask yourself, “Did I break rules, hurt others, or not do
something I should have done? What do I think about myself that I did this or believe
I did this?” With shame, it also can be helpful to ask “What does this mean about how
the other person(s) feel(s)/think(s) about me?” or “What might they think if they knew
this about me?”
Summary of How to Identify Automatic Thoughts
When you are looking for the thoughts linked to a particular mood, be sure to ask yourself the two general questions from the Helpful Hints section on page 54 and the two or
three specific questions for the mood you are trying to understand. However, it is also
sometimes helpful to ask questions linked to other moods. For example, Aniya, who was
socially anxious, answered the question “What is the worst that could happen?” with “I
am not going to know what to say, and I’ll look stupid.” However, by asking the depression question “What does this mean about me?,” Aniya uncovered the thought “No one
will ever love me.” Like Aniya, you can use the mood labels at the end of the questions
as guides, but answering some of the questions associated with other moods may help
you identify additional important automatic thoughts.

Exercise: Connecting Thoughts and Moods
Worksheet 7.1 helps you make the connection between thoughts and specific moods as described
on the previous pages. Of the five moods described (depression, anxiety, anger, guilt, shame),
write on the line which mood you think is most likely to go with each thought. The first two have
been completed as examples.
Worksheet 7.1. Connecting Thoughts and Moods
Depression? Anxiety? Anger? Guilt? Shame?
1. I’m stupid and I’ll never understand this. Depression
2. I’m going to lose my job because I’m so late. Anxiety
3. She is being so unfair.
4. I shouldn’t have been so hurtful.
5. If people knew this about me, they wouldn’t like me.
6. When I give my speech, people will laugh at me.
7. It’s wrong for me to think about this.
8. He’s cheating and insulting me.
9. There’s no use in trying any more.
10. If something goes wrong, I can’t cope.
Below are the answers to Worksheet 7.1. Review the relevant paragraphs of this
chapter or Chapters 13, 14, and 15 to understand why these specific thoughts might be
connected to the moods listed.
1. I’m so stupid that I’ll never understand this. ............................. Depression
2. I’m going to lose my job because I’m so late. ............................ Anxiety
3. She is being so unfair. .............................................................. Anger

Exercise: Separating Situations, Moods, and Thoughts
Think of a time today or yesterday when you had a particularly strong mood, such as depression,
anger, anxiety, guilt, or shame. If there is a particular mood you are working on as you use this
book, choose a situation in which you felt that mood. Write about this experience on Worksheet
7.2, describing the situation, your moods, and your thoughts in as much detail as you can remember. This exercise is designed to help you define, separate, and understand the different parts of
your experience – an important step in learning to manage your moods.

Automatic Thoughts 59
Did you find that you experienced more than one mood in the situation you wrote
about? Often we have several moods in the same situation. Since there are likely to be
different thoughts associated with each mood, it is helpful to circle or mark the one mood
in column 2 that is most distressing to you. Then ask yourself the relevant questions to
identify thoughts connected to that mood. Learning to identify automatic thoughts can
be very interesting, and identifying them will help you understand why you feel the way
you feel in different situations. The more you pay attention to your thoughts, the easier
it is to identify several thoughts tied to a mood.
The first three columns of the Thought Record take an emotional situation in your
life and put it under a psychological microscope. You are learning to take a slice of your
personal experience and examine it more closely. This close look at what is going on in
the situation and within yourself is necessary before you move on to the second half of
the Thought Record, which will help you figure out what changes will help you feel
better.
Worksheet 7.3 (on the following page) is designed to give you more practice in
identifying your automatic thoughts. Automatic thoughts are the springboard for change
throughout the next few chapters of this book. Therefore, it is important for you to
become skilled at identifying them. Before reading ahead, complete Worksheet 7.3 for
another situation in which you had one or more of the moods you are concerned about.

Exercise: Identifying Automatic Thoughts
Remember, if you list more than one mood in column 2, circle or mark the mood you want to
put under the microscope. Use the questions at the bottom of column 3 to help you identify the
thoughts connected to the mood you circled or marked. Remember, you do not need to answer
every question in column 3. Ask yourself the first two general questions, and then some or all of
the questions specific to the moods you circled or marked in column 2.

Hot Thoughts
Imagine walking into a room, turning on a table lamp, and having no light appear. You
may discover that the lamp is unplugged or that the wall switch is turned off. Plugging
in the lamp and turning it on causes electricity to flow and the lamp lights up.
Wires that carry electricity are called “hot” wires. Similarly, the automatic thoughts
that are most strongly connected to intense moods are called “hot” thoughts. These are
the thoughts that conduct the emotional charge, so these are also the thoughts that are
most important for us to identify, examine, and consider whether we need to change
them to feel better.
To learn about hot automatic thoughts, let’s look at one of Vic’s Thought Records
(Figure 7.1). Vic wanted to identify automatic thoughts and images that would help him

(General Question) What was going through my mind
just before I got nervous?
Why is she reading it here? (Answer that
makes me nervous: She’s looking for problems
and will criticize me.)
(General Question) What images or memories do I have
in this situation?
A memory of my dad criticizing how I
mowed the lawn. His face is red and he looks
really upset with me.
(Specific Anxiety Question) What am I afraid might
happen?
She’ll be unhappy with my sales.
I bet the other salespeople did better this
month.
(Specific Anxiety Question) What is the worst that could
happen?
I’ll get fired or get a pay cut.
FIGURE 7.1. Vic’s partial Thought Record.
62 Mind Over Mood
understand his nervousness, so he circled this mood in Column 2. To help identify his
automatic thoughts, Vic asked himself the two general questions in the Helpful Hints
“Questions to Help Identify Automatic Thoughts” (p. 54). These questions are underlined in Figure 7.1. In addition, since his feeling of nervousness was most closely related
to the mood of anxiety, he asked himself the two anxiety questions from the Helpful
Hints, which are also underlined.
Notice that Vic described the situation and then identified and rated his moods. He
circled “Nervous” because this was the mood he wanted to learn more about. Because
different thoughts are connected to different moods, it is helpful to circle or mark the
mood you want to learn about. To figure out the automatic thoughts connected with
his nervousness, he asked himself some of the questions listed in the Helpful Hints on
page 54. He asked both of the general questions (“What was going through my mind
just before I started to feel this way?” and “What images or memories do I have in this
situation?”), as well as the specific questions related to anxiety (“What am I afraid might
happen?” “What is the worst that could happen?”), because nervousness is similar to
anxiety.
To find out which of his thoughts were hottest – most emotionally charged – Vic
considered each thought by itself to see how much that thought alone would make him
feel nervous. For example, if he thought only the first thought – “Why is she reading
it here?” – Vic decided he would have rated his nervousness 10%. However, when he
wrote in the answer to this question that made him most nervous, “She’s looking for
problems and will criticize me,” his anxiety rating increased. All of Vic’s ratings can be
seen here:
Thought Mood
Why is she reading it here? Nervous 10%
She’s looking for problems and will criticize me. Nervous 50%
A memory of my dad criticizing how I mowed the lawn. His face is red
and he looks really upset with me.
Nervous 40%
She’ll be unhappy with my sales. Nervous 40%
I bet the other salespeople did better this month. Nervous 80%
I’ll get fired or get a pay cut. Nervous 90%
As you can see, Vic’s first thought (“Why is she reading it here?”) did not make him
very nervous, so it was not particularly hot. His next three thoughts made him more
nervous, so these were hotter thoughts. His last two thoughts (“I bet the other salespeople did better this month,” and “I’ll get fired or get a pay cut”) made Vic extremely
nervous, and so these were the hottest thoughts. Asking yourself a number of questions,
as Vic did, makes it more likely that you will find hot thoughts to help you understand
your emotional reactions.
Automatic Thoughts 63
There is one last thing of importance on Vic’s Thought Record. Notice that the
childhood memory he recalled seemed closely tied to his reaction to the supervisor.
Later, Vic learned to look for similarities and differences between the supervisor’s reading his report and his dad’s criticizing his lawn mowing. Becoming aware of this memory, and learning to see the differences between his childhood experiences and his adult
experiences, helped Vic learn to react in more helpful ways with both his supervisor and
his wife.
Exercise: Identifying Hot Thoughts
Now you are ready to identify your own hot thoughts. For each of the automatic thoughts
you listed on Worksheet 7.3 on page 60, rate how much (0–100%) this thought alone led
you to feel the emotion you circled. Write the rating next to each thought. These ratings
will help you decide which one(s) are the hot thought(s). The hottest thought is the one
with the highest rating. Do these thoughts help you understand why you had this particular mood? On Worksheet 7.3, circle or mark the hot thought(s) for the mood you circled or
marked in column 2. If none of the thoughts listed are hot, ask yourself the questions in the
Helpful Hints on page 54 again, to try to identify additional automatic thoughts.
The skills taught in this chapter are so important that the chapter ends with a special
Thought Record. Worksheet 7.4 is similar to Worksheet 7.3, with the addition of a fourth
column in which you can rate the hotness of each automatic thought you identify. Notice
the helpful hints and questions at the bottom of column 3, which remind you what information to include in the “Automatic Thoughts” column.
Use Worksheet 7.4 until you can successfully identify your automatic thoughts and
find the hot thoughts connected to your moods. Before you move on to the next chapter, practice this skill until you are comfortable with it. We recommend that you complete
Worksheet 7.4 at least once a day for one week. (We have included four copies of this worksheet here for your convenience. Additional copies can be printed from www.guilford.com/
MOM2-materials.) It is important to be able to identify your hot thoughts and understand
the links between your thoughts and moods before you go on to the next steps. Once you
can figure out your hot thoughts, then you are ready to read Chapter 8, which teaches you
how to evaluate these thoughts and make changes that can lead to more adaptive ways
of thinking.
The more Thought Records you do, the faster you will feel better. Doing a Thought
Record is not a test. It is an exercise in identifying your thoughts and the thought patterns
that are connected to your moods. With continued practice, you will become more skilled
in completing Thought Records. As your skill increases, you are likely to feel better and
more in control of your life. Once you are skilled at filling out Worksheet 7.4, you are ready
to begin Chapter 8.

Chapter 7 Summary
X Automatic thoughts are thoughts that come into our minds spontaneously
throughout the day.
X Whenever we have strong moods, there are also automatic thoughts present
that provide clues to understanding our emotional reactions.
X Automatic thoughts can be words, images, or memories.
X To identify automatic thoughts, notice what goes through your mind when you
have a strong mood.
X Specific types of thoughts are linked to each mood. This chapter suggests
questions you can ask to identify these mood-specific thoughts.
X Hot thoughts are automatic thoughts that carry the strongest emotional charge.
These are usually the most valuable thoughts to test on a Thought Record.

Where’s the Evidence?
Vic: Stop, look, and relisten.
One Thursday evening, Vic and his wife, Judy, were standing in the kitchen discussing
their plans for the upcoming weekend. Vic told Judy that he had made plans for Saturday morning to meet his friend Jim at an AA meeting. Judy’s expression changed as he
spoke, and a look of distress came over her face. Vic experienced a surge of anger as he
thought, “She’s upset that I’m spending time away from her and the kids. It’s not fair that
she doesn’t see my recovery program as important. If she cared about me as much as she
cared about the kids, she’d be happy I was going. She doesn’t care about me.”
Vic exploded at Judy: “If you don’t care about my sobriety, then I don’t care either!”
He slammed his fist on the table and stormed out of the house. As he left, Judy yelled
after him, “How can you expect me to care when you act like this? What’s wrong with
you?”
As Vic drove away from the house, his thoughts were racing: “She’s never understood how important AA is to me. She doesn’t know how hard it is not to drink. What’s
the use in trying so hard if she doesn’t care if I stay sober? I can’t stand being so angry. A
drink will make me feel better.”
As Vic neared the liquor store, he pulled his car into a parking lot and turned off the
ignition. He put his head on the steering wheel to catch his breath. As his anger began to
subside, he remembered his therapist telling him that next time he had a strong emotion
or urge to drink, he should use that as an opportunity to identify his thoughts and look
for evidence on a Thought Record. As much as Vic just wanted to get a drink, he had
promised his therapist he would do this at least once. Figure 8.1 shows what Vic wrote
on a piece of paper he found in the car.
As you learned to do in Chapter 7, Vic filled out the first three columns of the
Thought Record by describing the situation, identifying and rating his mood, and writing down a variety of thoughts connected to his mood. Instead of writing out his ratings
of how “hot” each automatic thought was, Vic mentally considered how angry each
thought made him feel and circled the hottest thought: “She doesn’t care about me.” He
70 Mind Over Mood
also circled another hot thought – “I can’t stand being so angry. A drink will make me
feel better.” – because Vic realized that these thoughts were pushing him toward drinking, which he knew he would regret later.
Once he identified these two hot thoughts, he remembered his therapist had told
him that columns 4 and 5 on the Thought Record ask the most important question in
CBT: “Where’s the evidence?” Vic began to consider evidence to support his thoughts
that Judy didn’t care about him and that he needed a drink to cope with his anger.
Vic’s anger began when he interpreted the look on his wife’s face as irritation with

his decision to attend a Saturday AA meeting. He then took that to mean that she didn’t
care about his recovery program or about him. By looking for evidence that did and did
not support his conclusions, Vic put himself in a better position to evaluate and react
to his thoughts about what was going on between him and Judy. As shown in the bottom half of columns 4 and 5, Vic also gathered evidence to test out his thought that he
couldn’t stand feeling angry and needed a drink to help him feel better.

are designed to help you gather information that supports and does not support the hot
thoughts you identified in the “Automatic Thoughts” column (column 3). The evidence
collected in columns 4 and 5 helps you evaluate your hot thoughts.
When you begin filling out the two evidence columns, it is helpful to think about
your hot thoughts as hypotheses, or guesses. If you temporarily suspend your certainty
that your hot thoughts are true, you will find it easier to look for evidence that both supports and doesn’t support your conclusion.
As Vic sat in his car outside the liquor store considering the evidence for and against
his beliefs about Judy and needing a drink, he tried to stick to data, facts, or actual experiences that did or did not support his hot thoughts.
Exercise: Facts versus Interpretations
Worksheet 8.1 helps you practice telling the difference between facts and interpretations. “Facts”
are generally things that everyone would agree on in a situation – things like “It was Thursday
night,” or “The expression on Judy’s face changed.” “Interpretations” are things people looking at
the same situation might disagree about. For each of the statements listed in the left column of
Worksheet 8.1, write on the line in the right column whether you think this is a fact or an interpretation about what went on between Vic and Judy. The first two have been completed as examples.
You may want to refer to the description of Judy and Vic’s fight at the beginning of this chapter on
page 69 before you decide if a statement is a fact or an interpretation.

Following are answers to Worksheet 8.1.
1. She’s always giving me negative looks. .................................... Interpretation
2. The expression on Judy’s face changed. .................................... Fact
3. I’m feeling angry [Vic]. ............................................................ Fact

10. You can’t expect me to care when you act like this [Judy]. ...... Interpretation
The information in the evidence columns of a Thought Record should consist mostly
of objective data or facts. However, when you first begin to fill out these columns, you
will probably mix facts with interpretations, as Vic did on his Thought Record. For
example, Vic wrote, “She’s always giving me negative looks, like she did tonight,” which
reflected his interpretation that her distressed look was a negative look directed at him.
Since Judy didn’t really say what she was thinking and feeling when she looked at him,
Vic didn’t really know for sure that her look was a “negative one” directed at him. Also,
“She’s always giving me negative looks, like she did tonight” might have been an exaggeration of how often Judy gave him negative looks.
Were you able to tell the difference between facts and interpretations on Worksheet
8.1? The facts are all things described at the beginning of the chapter. Anyone watching
Judy and Vic would probably agree that these things occurred: (2) The expression on
Judy’s face changed, (3) Vic was feeling angry, (6) Judy yelled at Vic as he was leaving
the house, and (7) Judy stayed with Vic through many years of drinking.
Interpretations are things we read into situations. These are our thoughts about the
situation or another person that may or may not be true. For example, it was possible that
(4) Judy didn’t care if Vic was sober, or that (5) she cared more about the kids than she
did about Vic. But since Judy had not really said these things, we wouldn’t know for sure
unless we decided to ask her. Similarly, Judy didn’t know for sure that (10) Vic couldn’t
expect her to care when he acted like this. This was her interpretation and might or
might not be accurate. Sometimes we need to gather more information before we know
if a statement is fact or interpretation. For example, Vic could directly ask Judy if she supported him in AA (8). Also, he could delay his drinking and find out if he could stand
being so angry for longer than he imagined (9).
Column 4 (“Evidence That Supports the Hot Thought”) and column 5 (“Evidence
That Does Not Support the Hot Thought”) of the Thought Record are designed to help
74 Mind Over Mood
you test the accuracy of your hot thoughts. As you practice completing the evidence columns for your own automatic thoughts, try to be factual in what you write. However,
even if you do include some ideas that are not facts in column 4, the Thought Record
will be valuable if you can find evidence to write in column 5. This column is one of
the most important on the Thought Record, because it asks you to look for information
that doesn’t support your conclusions. Evidence that does not support our beliefs can be hard to
uncover when we are experiencing a strong mood. Yet looking at the evidence both for and against
our conclusions is one secret to reducing the intensity of our moods.
If you notice, the first four columns of the Thought Record help us get clear and
specific about what is going on when we have strong moods. It isn’t until we get to
column 5 that we are asked to think about things differently. Perhaps for this reason,
column 5 is often the hardest step to master. Some people even draw a blank when they
get to column 5. In the Helpful Hints on page 75, we provide some questions you can
ask yourself to help complete column 5. It may take a few weeks of practice before you
find it easier to find evidence that does not support your hot thought (column 5). As you
complete more Thought Records, it will get easier for you to find evidence that doesn’t
support your hot thoughts.
Ben: Second thoughts.
An example from Ben’s life further illustrates the importance of using factual evidence to
test out our interpretations and conclusions. Approximately three months after his therapy began, Ben felt very sad as he returned home from a day spent visiting his daughter
and her family. After he arrived home, Ben decided to fill out a Thought Record in
order to understand his sadness better and to try to improve his mood.
After identifying a series of automatic thoughts, Ben decided that they were all
“hot.” However, the one that seemed most closely connected to his sadness was the idea
that he wasn’t needed any more by his children and grandchildren. Ben circled this as his
hottest thought on the Thought Record in Figure 8.2 on pages 76–77.
When we have negative automatic thoughts, we usually dwell on data that confirm our conclusions. Before Ben filled out his Thought Record, his thoughts were focused on the
column 4 events supporting his belief that “The kids and grandkids don’t need me any
more.” Thinking only about the ways in which he was no longer needed by his family
led Ben to feel very sad. Thinking about negative experiences is natural when we are
depressed.
Column 5 of the Thought Record required Ben to actively search his memory for
experiences that did not support his conclusions. When Ben recalled events indicating
that he was still needed and loved by his family, his mood lifted. Even though his children were grown up and his grandchildren were doing more things for themselves, Ben
was able to remember events suggesting that he was still an important person in their
lives.
The realization that he was still important to his family was not available to Ben as
long as he focused only on evidence that supported his negative thoughts. Column 5
 Where’s the evidence? 75
encouraged Ben to actively remember and examine information and experiences that
did not support his original negative automatic thoughts.
Like Ben, you will probably experience a shift in mood if you can fi nd evidence to
write in column 5. However, if you are experiencing a very strong mood or holding a
belief that seems absolutely true to you, it can be hard to see the evidence that does not
support your beliefs. The questions in the Helpful Hints above, which remind you to

Questions to help Find evidence that does not support your hot thought
• Have I had any experiences or is there any information that suggests
that this thought is not completely true all the time?
• If my best friend or someone I loved had this thought, what would
I tell them?
• If my best friend or someone who cares about me knew I was thinking this thought, what would they say to me? What factual evidence
(information or experiences) would they point out to me that suggests my hot thought is not 100% true?
• Are there any small pieces of information that contradict my hot
thought that I might be ignoring or discounting as not important?
• Are there any strengths or qualities I have that I am ignoring? What
are they? How might they help in this situation?
• Are there any positives in this situation that I am ignoring? Is there
any information that suggests there might be a positive outcome in
this situation?
• Have I been in this type of situation before? What happened? Is
there anything different between this situation and previous ones?
What have I learned from prior experiences that could help me
understand this situation differently?
• When I am not feeling this way, do I think about this type of situation any differently? How? What factual information do I focus on?
• When I have felt this way in the past, what did I think about that
helped me feel better?
• Five years from now, if I look back at this situation, will I look at it
any differently? Will I focus on any different part of my experience?
• Am I jumping to any conclusions in columns 3 and 4 that are not
completely justifi ed by the facts?
• Am I blaming myself for something over which I do not have complete control? What facts can I write down that refl ect a more fair,
compassionate, or kind view of my responsibility?

“These emotions are so painful that I have to kill myself, because I can’t stand

You were able to find evidence to support that thought, but you were unable

Marissa: That’s right.
Therapist: Have you ever felt in the past that your pain was so great that you had
to kill yourself?
Marissa: Dozens of times.
Therapist: In the past when you have felt this way, what have you done or thought
about that has helped you to feel better?

have you ever had any thoughts that have helped you feel better?
Marissa: When I’m feeling the worst, I try to remember that I have felt this way

Therapist: Well, that is important information. Is there anything about your situation now to suggest that suicide is not the only option?
Marissa: What do you mean?
Therapist: I’m wondering whether or not you have any hope that something other
than suicide will lessen your pain.
Marissa: Well, I guess I’m learning to think differently, but I’m not so sure that’s

Therapist: If Kate told you that she was in so much emotional pain that she thought
suicide was the only solution, what would you say to her?
Marissa: I would tell her to keep trying other solutions. There would have to be
hope for Kate. But I don’t see much hope for me.
Therapist: We’ll consider how much hope makes sense in a few minutes. First, let’s
write on the Thought Record the things we just talked about that can go in
column 5.
Figure 8.4 reflects the information Marissa gathered with her therapist’s help.
It is important to write down the evidence you uncover while answering the questions
in the Helpful Hints on page 75. Marissa remained quite hopeless while discussing this
evidence with her therapist. But when she wrote it down on her Thought Record, she
discovered that seeing it all at once did make her feel somewhat more hopeful and less
depressed. Similarly, you will benefit more from writing down the evidence you gather
rather than simply thinking about it.

Linda: Heart attack or anxiety?
As her treatment progressed, Linda became more skilled at asking herself the questions
that allowed her to complete column 5 of the Thought Record. This skill helped Linda
prevent her anxiety symptoms from escalating into a panic attack. As Linda sat in an
airplane waiting for it to take off, she began to feel anxious. She decided to record her

experience on a Thought Record, to see if she could identify and examine the thoughts
connected to her anxiety. As shown in Figure 8.5, Linda began by describing the situation, her mood, and automatic thoughts. Once she identified her hot thought – “I’m having a heart attack” – Linda wrote down the evidence that supported this idea in column
4. Then Linda began to gather evidence that did not support her hot thought. As she was
sitting on the airplane, Linda thought about what her best friend might tell her if she were
sitting next to her. She knew that her friend would tell her that her rapid heartbeat was
probably caused by her nervousness and anxiety, and did not necessarily mean that she
was having a heart attack. Furthermore, Linda remembered that her physician had told
her that her heart was a muscle, and making it beat faster was part of healthy exercise. He
told her that a rapid heartbeat is not necessarily dangerous, nor is it a definite sign of a
heart attack. He found nothing wrong with her heart after a thorough exam.
Linda also asked herself whether she had had any experiences demonstrating that

Exercise: Identifying Evidence That Supports and Doesn’t
Support Hot Thoughts
Just as Linda asked herself the questions from the Helpful Hints on page 75 to help her
gather evidence that did not support her hot thought, you can use the same questions
to look for evidence that doesn’t support the hot thoughts you identified on your copies
of Worksheet 7.4 (pp. 64–67). Look back at these copies of Worksheet 7.4 now. Choose
two or three of these thoughts to continue working with on Worksheet 8.2 on the following pages. Alternatively, if you do not want to continue working with the thoughts you
identified on your copies of Worksheet 7.4, identify two or three situations in which you
recently had strong moods, and complete copies of Worksheet 8.2 for them.
On each copy of Worksheet 8.2, circle or mark the hot thought that you will test.
In columns 4 and 5, write out information that supports and doesn’t support the hot
thought you marked.
Try to list in column 4 only factual evidence that supports your hot thought, not
your interpretations of the facts. For example, “Peter stared at me” is an example of factual evidence. The statement, “Peter stared at me and thought I was crazy,” would not
be factual unless Peter had actually said aloud, “I think you are crazy.” If Peter had been
staring silently, your assumption that you knew what he was thinking is a guess and may
or may not be accurate.
Once you have completed column 4, ask yourself the questions in the Helpful Hints
on page 75 to look for evidence that does not support your hot thought. Write down in
column 5 each piece of evidence you uncover. Completing these two “Evidence” columns of the Thought Record allows you to evaluate your hot thought from different
angles, and may provide information that will help you develop an alternative way of
seeing things.

Chapter 9 will teach you what you need to know to complete the last two columns
of the Thought Record. Before proceeding to the next chapter, practice identifying evidence for five or six more hot thoughts by completing the first five columns on several
more copies of Worksheet 8.2. (Additional copies of this worksheet can be printed from
www.guilford.com/MOM2-materials.) You can use the thoughts you identified on Worksheet 7.4, or you can use new thoughts. The more you practice looking for evidence for
and against hot thoughts, the more quickly you will develop the type of flexible thinking that is linked to feeling better.
Now is a good time to measure your moods again. Remember, you can use the following measures and graphs to record your scores:

Akiko was at home with the flu and asked her 7-year-old daughter, Yuki, to play quietly while she rested. An hour later, Akiko walked into the kitchen to make some
tea and was distressed to see crayons spread all over the floor, shredded colored paper,
an open bottle of glue on the table, scissors in the wastebasket, and a half-drunk glass of
milk on the counter next to the refrigerator.
Furious about the mess, Akiko went looking for Yuki and found her sleeping soundly
in front of the television in the living room. On the cushion near Yuki’s head was a large,
brightly colored card, covered in hearts that read, “I love you, Mom! Please get well
soon!” Akiko shook her head slowly and smiled. She tucked a blanket around Yuki’s
shoulders and returned to the kitchen to make her tea.
Sometimes a little bit of additional information shifts our interpretation and understanding of
a situation 180 degrees. When Akiko first walked into the kitchen, she was not expecting
a mess and immediately felt angry that Yuki had made one, especially when Akiko was
sick. Akiko’s hot thought accompanying her anger was “Yuki is so inconsiderate to make
such a mess when she knows I’m sick.”
When Akiko discovered the beautiful get-well card, her emotional response shifted
immediately. Akiko thought, “Yuki was concerned for me and wanted to help me feel
better – how thoughtful!” Feelings of appreciation and tenderness toward Yuki followed
this alternative thought. Learning the meaning behind the mess led to a shift in Akiko’s
attitude and mood.
Vic: Gathering new evidence.
Chapter 8 began with a description of Vic’s reaction to the change in his wife’s facial
expression when he told her he had plans to attend a Saturday AA meeting. Vic’s interpretation of Judy’s facial expression was “She’s upset that I’m spending time away from
96 Mind Over Mood
her and the kids.” His anger was fueled by further thoughts: “It’s not fair that she doesn’t
see my recovery program as important,” “If she cared about me as much as she cares
about the kids, she’d be happy I was going to AA,” and “She doesn’t care about me.”
Vic’s interpretation of Judy’s expression affected his behaviors as well as his emotions. He yelled at Judy, slammed his fist on the table, stormed out of the house, and
drove to a nearby liquor store. Fortunately, before going into the liquor store, Vic filled
out a Thought Record that looked for evidence both supporting and not supporting the
hot thought, “She doesn’t care about me” (see Figure 8.1)
As Vic considered all the information on his Thought Record, he realized that Judy
did seem to care for him in many important ways. In fact, he began to wonder why she
would be upset about his plan to attend an AA meeting. Vic’s therapist had pointed out
that Vic’s distress at work often followed instances where Vic made assumptions about
what his supervisor was thinking – assumptions that were often wrong. Vic began to
wonder whether he was wrong in his assumption about what Judy was thinking.

Instead of buying alcohol at the liquor store, Vic decided to call his AA sponsor.
After talking with Vic for a few minutes, his sponsor advised him to go to an AA meeting before heading home. After ending the conversation with his sponsor, Vic decided to
telephone Judy. As Vic and Judy began to talk about their argument, Vic decided to test
his assumptions by asking Judy about her reaction when he told her he had made plans
to go to the AA meeting on Saturday. Judy’s response surprised Vic. She said that when
he mentioned Saturday, she had remembered that Saturday was her sister’s birthday, and
she’d forgotten to mail a card. Judy had been concerned that her sister would be upset
or hurt if a card didn’t arrive on time. Judy had not been aware of a change in her facial
expression, but if it had changed, she was certain that these were the thoughts that had
caused it – she hadn’t been thinking about Vic at all! As shown in Figure 9.1, Vic wrote
these alternative explanations in column 6 of his Thought Record.
Vic sheepishly told Judy that he had thought her look meant that she was upset with
him for planning to attend an AA meeting on Saturday, and that he had been angry

because he thought this meant that she didn’t care about him or his sobriety. Judy voiced
her support for Vic’s recovery program and told him that she had worried while he was
gone that he would drink and be killed driving. She said she loved him very much,
although his quick anger was becoming increasingly difficult for her to tolerate. Vic
sincerely apologized. He reminded her that he was working on his anger, and he asked
her to be patient with him.
Both Akiko’s change in mood when she saw the get-well card and Vic’s realization
that his wife’s facial expression had nothing to do with him illustrate how new or additional information can shift one’s perspective of a distressing situation. Vic and Akiko
each discovered an alternative explanation for an event that was less distressing than
their original interpretation. Vic and Akiko each felt better after gathering evidence and
understanding their situation in a different way.
In Chapter 8, you learned to ask yourself questions to actively look for evidence that
supports and doesn’t support your hot thoughts (see the Helpful Hints on p. 75). Sometimes the evidence you find shows that your hot thoughts do not tell the whole story.
Akiko discovered that her 7-year-old daughter’s mess was the result of her daughter’s
love and caring. Vic found out that his wife’s facial expression was not a negative reaction
to him. When the evidence in columns 4 and 5 of the Thought Record does not support your original automatic thought, write an alternative explanation for the situation
in column 6, as illustrated in Figure 9.1.
Notice that Vic rated his belief in his alternative thoughts very high. He completely
believed that Judy’s change in facial expression was due to remembering her sister’s
birthday, and so he rated his belief in this alternative thought as 100%. He was also
completely confident after their discussion that Judy supported his AA attendance and
wanted him to stay sober. Vic rated his belief in the last alternative thought – that Judy
cared about him – as 80%. He strongly believed that she cared, but he still had a few lingering doubts. The alternative view(s) of a situation you write should take into account
all the evidence you have written down in columns 4 and 5.
Vic’s perspective changed almost completely. He shifted from a belief that Judy didn’t
care to one that she did. As it did with Vic, sometimes the evidence leads to a total shift
in perspective. At other times, the new view of the situation will be more of a balanced
perspective that is based on the evidence supporting and not supporting the hot thought.
To construct a balanced thought, it helps to write one or two sentences that summarize your entries in column 4 of the Thought Record, and another one or two sentences
that summarize your entries in column 5. If appropriate, you can connect the two sets
of sentences with the word “and.” For example, after examining the evidence, someone
who originally thinks, “I’m a bad parent,” might arrive at this more balanced thought:
 Alternative or Balanced Thinking 99
“I’ve made some mistakes as a parent, and yet all parents make mistakes. Making some
mistakes doesn’t make me a bad parent. I love my children, and I think the good things
that I’ve done outweigh the mistakes that I’ve made.” This statement is probably a more
balanced view of all the person’s parenting experiences than the original hot thought,
“I’m a bad parent,” which focuses only on negative parenting experiences.
alternative or Balanced thinking
In column 6 of the Thought Record you will want to summarize the
important evidence collected and recorded in columns 4 and 5.
1. If the evidence does not support your hot thought(s), write an alternative view of the situation that is consistent with the evidence.
2. If the evidence only partially supports your hot thought(s), write a
balanced thought that summarizes the evidence supporting and not
supporting your original thought.
3. Make sure your alternative thought or your balanced thought is consistent with the evidence summarized in columns 4 and 5.
4. Rate your belief in the new alternative or balanced thought(s) on a
0–100% scale.
Alternative or balanced thinking often results from looking at the evidence you
have gathered in columns 4 and 5. Looking at the evidence that both supports and
doesn’t support your hot thought provides a broader perspective on the situation you
are in. Alternative or balanced thinking is often more positive than the initial automatic
thought, but it is not merely the substitution of a positive thought for a negative thought.
Positive thinking tends to ignore negative information and can be as damaging as negative thinking. For example, you wouldn’t want to replace the hot thought “I’m a bad
parent” with “I’m a great parent” if you are thinking about a situation in which you
made some parenting mistakes. Alternative or balanced thinking takes into account both
negative and positive information. It is an attempt to understand the meaning of all the
available information. With this additional information, your interpretation of an event
may change. Questions you can ask yourself to help arrive at a balanced or alternative
thought appear in the following Helpful Hints.

Questions to help arrive at alternative or Balanced thinking
• Based on the evidence I have listed in columns 4 and 5 of the
Thought Record, is there an alternative or balanced way of thinking
about or understanding this situation?
• If an alternative view of the situation emerges from the evidence in
columns 4 and 5, write it in column 6. Otherwise, write a balanced
thought.
• To write a balanced thought, write one statement summarizing
all the evidence that supports my hot thought(s) (column 4), and
another statement summarizing all the evidence that does not support my hot thought(s) (column 5). Does combining the two summary statements with the word “and” create a balanced thought
that takes into account all the information I have gathered?
• If someone I cared about was in this situation, had these thoughts,
and had this information available, what alternative view(s) of the
situation would I suggest?
• If someone who cares about me knew I had my hot thought(s), what
might this person say is another way of understanding this situation?
• If a hot thought is supported, what is the worst outcome? If a hot

supported, what is the most likely outcome?

Column 7 of the Thought Record asks you to rerate the moods you have identifi ed
in column 2. If you have constructed a balanced/alternative thought that is believable
to you, you will probably notice that the intensity of your negative mood has decreased,
and your moods may even change.
The following examples demonstrate how Marissa, Ben, and Linda developed alternative or balanced thoughts and completed columns 6 and 7 of their Thought Records.
These examples complete the Thought Records begun in Chapter 8 (Figures 8.2, 8.4,
and 8.6).
Alternative or Balanced Thinking 101
Ben: Balanced thinking.
As described in Chapter 8, Ben completed a Thought Record regarding his experiences after spending the day with his daughter’s family (Figure 8.2). Ben identified his
hot automatic thought as “The kids and grandkids don’t need me any more.” Ben then
gathered evidence that supported and did not support his hot thought. After writing the
evidence in columns 4 and 5 of the Thought Record, Ben reviewed the questions in the
Helpful Hints on the facing page, to help construct a balanced thought for column 6.
Ben pondered the questions in the Helpful Hints while he studied the evidence in
columns 4 and 5. At first, he struggled to see the situation differently. After looking several times at the evidence in column 5, Ben concluded that the evidence did not consistently support his hot thought, “The kids and grandkids don’t need me any more.” Ben
decided that a more accurate and balanced way of understanding his experiences was:
“Even though my children and grandchildren don’t need me in the same ways they used
to, they still seem to enjoy being with me and asked for my advice a few times. They
paid attention to me, although the attention was not the same as it has been in the past.”
After Ben wrote this balanced thought, he noticed that the intensity rating of his sadness
decreased from 80% to 30%. His completed Thought Record is shown in Figure 9.2.
If Ben had simply substituted a positive thought, he might have written, “They need
me more than ever.” If he had merely attempted to rationalize away his sadness, he might
have thought, “They don’t need me any more, but what do I care?” Positive thinking
and rationalization can both lead to problems. For Ben, positive thinking would have
ignored real changes that were taking place in his family (his children and grandchildren
were getting older). Rationalization could have led Ben to feel even more isolated and
alone. In contrast, Ben’s balanced thought emerged from the evidence and allowed Ben
to understand his experience in a way that lessened his sadness and increased his connection to his family.
Furthermore, notice that Ben’s balanced thoughts were believable to him. He rated
his belief in these new thoughts at 85% and 90%. The more an alternative or balanced
thought is believable to you, the more it will reduce the intensity of your negative moods
or change your mood altogether. If you simply write a rationalization or a positive
thought that you do not believe in column 6, it is not likely to have a lasting impact on
your mood.

Marissa: Alternative thinking.
As described in Chapter 8, Marissa described an experience in which she felt depressed,
disappointed, empty, confused, and unreal (Figures 8.3 and 8.4). She identified numerous automatic thoughts and decided that the hot thought was “These emotions are so
painful that I have to kill myself, because I can’t stand them any more.” Marissa completed columns 4 and 5 of the Thought Record with the help of her therapist. To complete column 6, Marissa reviewed the questions in the Helpful Hints (p. 100) with her
therapist. The question that was most relevant for Marissa was “If my friend Kate was in
this situation, had these thoughts, and had this information available, what alternative
view(s) of the situation would I suggest?” Marissa concluded that she would suggest to
Kate, “Even though you are in a lot of pain right now, talking to somebody who cares
about you has helped you to feel better in the past. You know this feeling won’t last
forever, and you will feel better at some point. Suicide is not the only solution – you are
learning new skills that may help you feel better and stay better longer.” Marissa’s completed Thought Record is shown in Figure 9.3.
It was easier for Marissa to think of alternatives to suicide when she imagined the

advice she would give to Kate. By doing this, she was able to distance herself from her
own thoughts and find a different perspective. She was able to see that there was an alternative way of thinking about her emotional pain. Even though her alternative thoughts
were only slightly believable to Marissa, they still made a small, positive difference in how
she felt. Even this small change had an important effect on Marissa’s desire to kill herself.
Her therapist reminded her that she had had these automatic thoughts and feelings for a
long time, so even small changes could be interpreted as encouraging and hopeful.
The amount of change you notice in your moods when you rerate them in column
7 will depend upon how much you believe your alternative or balanced thoughts. Since
Marissa believed her alternative thoughts only slightly (ratings of 10–20%), her mood did
not change very much. Over time, if she has experiences that match her alternative views,
Marissa’s moods will shift more as her hope for improvement becomes more believable to
her. It is important that balanced and alternative views are based on evidence gathered in
columns 4 and 5. The more your alternative views are linked to real experiences that you
have had, the more strongly you are likely to believe these new ideas.

structing the balanced thought “Even though my children and grandchildren don’t need
me in the same ways they used to, they still seem to enjoy being with me and asked for
my advice a few times,” Ben’s sadness rating dropped to 30%.
Ben’s sadness did not disappear completely after he completed a Thought Record,
even though his balanced thought was highly believable (85%) to him. Some sadness
remained, because some of the evidence reminded Ben of real losses he was experiencing.
The goal of a Thought Record is not to eliminate emotions. Instead, the Thought Record
is designed to help you gain a broader perspective on a situation, so that your emotional
reactions are balanced responses to both the positive and negative aspects of a situation.
What If Your Mood Did Not Change?
If your Thought Record was completed properly and your mood did not change, there
are two likely possibilities.
1. Sometimes, after you look at all the evidence, it mostly supports your hot thought.
The Thought Record is not intended to disprove your hot thought, but to investigate
it and find out if you are ignoring important evidence – as we often do when we have
strong emotions. If your hot thought is mostly supported by the evidence, then you may
need either to complete an Action Plan or to practice acceptance before your mood
will improve. Chapter 10 helps you develop Action Plans and/or learn how to develop
greater acceptance. An Action Plan outlines steps you can take to make a situation better.
Acceptance can be a helpful strategy, especially when you cannot make things better or
you are in the midst of a difficult period in your life.
2. Other times, even though all the evidence does not support your hot thought,
you have a hard time believing the alternative or balanced thought because your hot
thought is a “core belief” – a type of deeply held negative belief that doesn’t easily
change even in the face of evidence. When you read Chapter 12 you will learn for additional ideas for shifting core beliefs.
What should you think or do if there is no change in your mood ratings after you
complete a Thought Record? First, review your Thought Record to make sure you completed it properly. On the following page you will find questions to ask yourself if there
has been no change in your moods after you have completed a Thought Record.
Alternative or Balanced Thinking 107
Questions to Determine Reason for No Mood Change
after Completing a Thought Record
If there is no change in your mood ratings after you complete a Thought
Record, ask yourself the following questions:
• Have I described a specific situation?
• Did I accurately identify and rate my moods in column 2?
• Is the thought I am testing a hot thought for the mood I want to change?
• Did I list multiple hot thoughts? If so, I may need to gather data supporting and not supporting each hot thought before my mood shifts.
• Is there an even hotter thought missing from my Thought Record that
needs to be tested?
• Did I write down all the evidence that does not support the hot thought(s)
I am evaluating? There should have been several pieces of evidence in
column 5 before I wrote an alternative or balanced thought.
• Is the alternative or balanced thought I wrote in column 6 believable to
me? If not, I will review the evidence again and try to write an alternative
or balanced view that seems more believable.
• Does the evidence strongly support my hot thought? Then I may need to
do an Action Plan or develop an attitude of acceptance regarding this situation and my reactions to it (see Chapter 10).
• Does the alternative or balanced thought match the evidence but I still
don’t believe it? Then I may need to gather additional evidence as described
in Chapter 11, or work on core beliefs as described in Chapter 12.

Linda: Alternative thinking.
It is sometimes easier to recognize alternative ways of seeing situations for other people
than for ourselves. As described in Chapter 8, Linda wrote out a Thought Record that
described her fear while sitting in an airplane on a runway awaiting takeoff (see Figures
8.5 and 8.6). Her partially completed Thought Record is duplicated on Worksheet 9.1.

Exercise: Helping Linda Arrive at an Alternative or Balanced Thought
In columns 4 and 5, Linda wrote down evidence that supported and did not support her hot
thought “I’m having a heart attack.” Based on this evidence, write in column 6 of Worksheet 9.1
a believable alternative or balanced thought that would reduce Linda’s fear. If you have difficulty
completing this exercise, refer to the Helpful Hints on page 100 for suggestions.

There can be more than one alternative or balanced thought that fits the evidence.
When Linda completed column 6, she studied the evidence from columns 4 and 5 and
considered alternatives to her hot thought. The evidence suggested that she was not having a heart attack, but that her rapid heartbeat and sweating were caused by her anxiety
and were in no way dangerous or harmful. Instead of thinking, “I’m having a heart
attack,” Linda considered her alternative thoughts: “My heart is racing and I am sweating because I’m anxious/nervous about being on an airplane. My doctor told me that
a rapid heartbeat is not necessarily dangerous, and in all likelihood my heartbeat will

finished while she was still on the runway, is shown in Figure 9.4.
As Linda thought differently about her rapid heartbeat and sweating, her fear dropped
considerably. Her fear was connected to her thought “I’m having a heart attack,” and not
simply to her physical experiences of her heart beating rapidly and of sweating. When
she examined the evidence for and against her thought and concluded that she was not
having a heart attack, Linda’s became less fearful.

112 Mind Over Mood
Now you have learned what you need to know to complete all seven columns of
a Thought Record. Thought Records help you identify, examine, and perhaps change
the thinking and beliefs that contribute to your distress. Constructing alternative or balanced thoughts helps free you from automatic thinking patterns that contribute to the
difficulties you are having. If you are able to see yourself and situations from a different
perspective, it is likely that you will feel better about yourself and your life.
Complete two or three Thought Records per week to help improve your skills in
developing alternative and balanced thinking. (There are additional copies of Worksheet
9.2 in the Appendix of this book.) In the future, whenever you get stuck evaluating a
thought, you can write down the evidence and a balanced or alternative thought on a
Thought Record.
There are three advantages to completing Thought Records regularly. First, we
often respond in emotional ways that can be a bit confusing. For example, at first Linda
did not realize why she was panicking on the airplane. Thought Records can help you
make sense of your emotional reactions, just as they did for Linda. Second, a Thought
Record can help you broaden your perspective on troubling situations, so that you react
in ways that are consistent with the “big picture” rather than a narrow and possibly
distorted view. Third, repeated practice filling out Thought Records actually helps you
learn to think more flexibly. After completing 20–40 Thought Records, many people
report that they automatically begin to think alternative or balanced thoughts in distressing situations without writing out a Thought Record. When you reach this point,
you will experience fewer and fewer situations as truly distressing, and you can spend
your energy on solving what problems remain and on enjoying yourself in more situations.
What If Your Hot Thought Is Supported by the Evidence?
Before we end this chapter, we want to clarify a really important point. Thus far, you
might get the impression that Thought Records are designed to show that negative
thoughts are always inaccurate or unbalanced. This is not the case.
We usually do a Thought Record when we are experiencing a strong emotion. We
know from research that when we have strong emotions, we think mostly about experiences that fit that emotion. When we are sad, for example, we think about sad things;
Alternative or Balanced Thinking 113
when we are ashamed, we think about all the bad things we have done. Therefore, most
of the time when we decide to fill out a Thought Record, it will help us get a different
and more balanced view of things, because it prompts us to think about things that are
not consistent with our mood.
However, sometimes our hot thoughts are accurate and good descriptions of difficult situations. For instance, one of our hot thoughts may be “My boss is abusing me,”
and this may be accurate. Vic might think, “If I keep losing my temper, Judy might get
tired of this and leave me.” In these instances, the Thought Record does its job in two
ways: (1) It helps us test whether our hot thought is accurate, just to make sure we are not
jumping to an emotion-driven conclusion; and (2) if we find out that the hot thought
is supported by the evidence, it alerts us that this is something we need to manage or
change in some way. The next chapter teaches a variety of ways to handle hot thoughts
that are supported by the evidence, including problem solving, reexamining the meanings we put on situations, developing acceptance, and learning to be resilient in the face
of our difficulties.
Mood Check-Up
As a reminder, as long as you are actively using this book, we recommend you complete
mood measures every week or two. At this point in the book, you have learned a lot of
Mind Over Mood skills. This is a good time to complete mood ratings to see what impact
these skills are having on your moods. Be sure to rate and graph all the moods you are
tracking, including your happiness. Remember, you can use the following measures and
worksheets to record your scores:

X Column 6 of the Thought Record, “Alternative/Balanced Thoughts,” summarizes
the important evidence collected and recorded in columns 4 and 5.
X If the evidence in columns 4 and 5 does not support the original hot thought,
write in column 6 an alternative view of the situation that is consistent with the
evidence.
X If the evidence in columns 4 and 5 only partially supports your original hot
thought, write a balanced thought in column 6 that summarizes the evidence
both supporting and not supporting your original thought.
X Ask yourself the questions in the Helpful Hints (p. 100) to help construct an
alternative or balanced thought.
X Alternative or balanced thoughts are not merely positive thinking. Instead,
they reflect new ways of thinking about the situation based on all the available
evidence written in columns 4 and 5.
X In column 7 of the Thought Record, rerate the intensity of the mood(s) you
identified in column 2.
X The shift in emotional response to a situation is often related to the believability
of your alternative or balanced thoughts. This is why we rate how strongly we
believe the alternative or balanced thought.
X If there is no shift in your mood after completing a Thought Record, use the
“Questions to Determine Reason for No Mood Change” (p. 107) to discover what
else you may need to do to feel better.
X The more Thought Records you complete, the easier it will become to think
more flexibly and begin to consider alternative or balanced explanations for
events automatically without writing out the evidence.

New Thoughts, Action Plans,
and Acceptance
J
ia enrolled in a Spanish class to prepare for a trip to Mexico. She learned to ask directions, order food, and carry on simple conversations. When Jia arrived in Mexico, her
taxi driver spoke English, as did the people working in her hotel. After unpacking, she
decided to go to the neighborhood pharmacy to buy some postcards and stamps.
In the pharmacy, everyone was speaking Spanish rapidly. Jia reviewed her digital
translator, and then stepped hesitantly up to the counter and spoke the phrases in Spanish
she believed would order stamps and postcards. To Jia’s surprise, the woman behind the
counter smiled and handed her the number of cards and stamps she wanted to purchase.
Why was Jia surprised?
Our first learning of something new tends to be intellectual, or “in our heads.” We
know that a particular language is supposed to work in another country – but when we
actually speak this language, we doubt that it will be understood, because the words and
phrases are so different from the language most familiar to us. In the beginning, our
native language seems the only true way to speak. A new language begins to feel like
true communication only after a lot of practice.
Even though Jia believed that her Spanish phrases were correct, she did not have
confidence in the language until she began to receive positive reactions from the people
she met in Mexico. As she spoke Spanish more regularly, she gained greater confidence.
Developing new alternative or balanced thoughts may be like writing in a new language for you. Like any new language, new thoughts probably seem awkward and only
partly believable. While your automatic thoughts flow easily, like your familiar native
language, your alternative thoughts emerge only with great effort. You probably believe
the new thoughts “in your head,” but they don’t feel as if they fit your life experience as
well as the old automatic thoughts do.
As Jia did while learning Spanish, the best way to increase the believability of your
118 Mind Over Mood
alternative or balanced thoughts is to try them out in your day-to-day life to gather
more evidence. If your life experiences support your alternative and more balanced
thoughts, you will begin to believe these new thoughts more, and your improved mood
will become more stable. If your experiences do not support your new beliefs, you can
use this information to create different alternative thoughts that fit your experiences
better.
Ben: Gathering more evidence and strengthening new thoughts.
Ben’s sad mood on the day he visited his daughter’s family improved when he realized
that although his children and grandchildren didn’t need him in the same ways they
used to, they still enjoyed his company and sometimes asked for his advice. Although
this alternative thought (see Chapter 9, especially Figure 9.2, pp. 102–103) helped Ben
feel better, his new way of thinking was not fully believable to him – even though the
evidence seemed to support the new idea. One way for Ben to strengthen his belief in
his new conclusion was to gather more information about his alternative thoughts. Ben
decided to test his new conclusions (“They still enjoy being with me, even though they
don’t need me in the same ways they used to”). He called his daughter and son-in-law
and offered to help them on a project. His daughter told him that they didn’t have any
projects that needed help. Rather than concluding that he wasn’t needed any more, as
he had done in the past, Ben decided to ask her if he could help them in any other
way.
After thinking for a moment, his daughter told Ben that his granddaughter Amy’s
best friend had moved out of town. Amy had been feeling lonely, especially after school
when she normally spent time with her friend. She asked if Ben would be able and willing to do something with Amy. Ben eagerly agreed to spend time with Amy two or
three times a week after school.
Amy also liked this idea, especially when Ben asked her what she might be interested
in doing. She said that she had recently joined a soccer team and would like to practice
soccer. Ben agreed to drive her to a field where they would have room to do this. Amy
was pleased because the field was too far away to walk or bicycle, and her parents were
working and couldn’t drive her. Ben was glad to be able to participate in this part of his
granddaughter’s life.
This experience led to information that strengthened Ben’s alternative thought
(“They still enjoy being with me, even though they don’t need me in the same ways
they used to”). His family’s reaction increased Ben’s belief in his new thought, improved
his confidence in acting on this belief, and created enjoyable and positive time with
Amy. With his previous style of thinking, Ben would have felt rejected and would have
given up when his daughter and son-in-law told him that they didn’t have any projects
(“What’s the use? They don’t need me any more”). Ben’s alternative thoughts gave him
the confidence to find new ways to feel needed, instead of giving up when his initial
offer was declined.

Marissa: Making an Action Plan to keep a job.
Sometimes when you gather evidence to test a thought, you find that most of the evidence
supports your thought, and so there isn’t a very believable alternative thought. When
this happens, it usually indicates there is a problem that needs to be solved. Although a
change in thinking is often helpful, it is not always the full solution. When most of the
evidence supports your thought, you may want to make an Action Plan.
120 Mind Over Mood
• If an alternative or balanced thought fi ts your life experiences but still
does not seem believable to you, gather more evidence to test and
strengthen the alternative or balanced thought, just as Ben did in his
phone conversation with his daughter.
• If the evidence from your life mostly supports your hot thought, then
this means you may have a problem to solve, and an Action Plan can
help you discover if and how you can solve the problem.
Marissa and her therapist spent several sessions determining the reasons why she had
become highly suicidal. One of the main reasons Marissa felt so hopeless was that she
was convinced she would be fi red from her job and would not be able to support herself
and her children. She had a life insurance policy and thought it would provide for her
children until they could support themselves.
Marissa tested the automatic thought “I will lose my job” on a Thought Record (see
Chapters 6–9). Although this thought could not be considered absolutely true until it
happened, Marissa had some pretty convincing evidence that losing her job was a real
possibility. In the previous month, she had received three warnings from her supervisor
– one for chronically arriving at work late in the morning and after lunch, and two for
“poor work product.” In her company, three warnings could be followed by termination
of employment.
Marissa felt out of control regarding her job. She was so depressed in the mornings
that it was hard to get out of bed, even though she knew it would look bad if she was
late again. Once she was at work, Marissa had a hard time concentrating, so she made
errors – which brought even more negative attention from her supervisor.
Since Marissa’s most distressing thought that she would lose her job had a lot of evidence to support it, she and her therapist constructed an Action Plan to help her solve
the problem. They discussed and wrote down a variety of actions Marissa could take to
improve her performance and make her job more secure. First, she could tell her supervisor that she was trying to do better and ask for help. This supervisor had complimented
Marissa on her work only a few months earlier. Marissa acknowledged that her supervisor might be willing to help if he knew she was trying to do better. Second, Marissa
decided she could ask Maggie, a friend in the offi ce whom Marissa trusted, to review her
work before Marissa handed it to the supervisor. Finally, Marissa considered a variety of
strategies to get herself to work on time even when she was depressed.
Marissa’s Action Plan led her to become more hopeful about keeping her job. After
a few minutes, however, she began to see problems that might interfere. The biggest
problem was that she didn’t feel comfortable telling her supervisor she was depressed,
because she wasn’t sure it was safe. She worried that he might tell other people, and then
she would feel ashamed. Her therapist suggested to Marissa that she consider what she
would be willing to say to her supervisor that might enlist his help.
Marissa decided to tell her supervisor that she was under a lot of stress, but that she
was working hard to straighten things out so that her job performance would not be
affected. She thought she could remind her supervisor that her work used to be better, let
reMInders
 New Thoughts, Action Plans, and Acceptance 121
him know that her current problems were temporary, and assure him that she expected
her performance to be better soon. Marissa’s therapist suggested she also let her supervisor know that she really wanted to keep her job and appreciated his help in letting her
know what she needed to do to maintain the company’s quality standards. Marissa’s
completed Action Plan is shown in Figure 10.1 on page 122.
Marissa’s hopelessness and thoughts of suicide decreased after she made the Action
Plan and began to follow it. Notice that she took several different steps to improve her
job performance. Since her depression was making it difficult for her to function well,
she enlisted the help of others for a short time. From her boss, she asked for an appropriate level of help and reminded him of her previous good work. She also asked her friend
Maggie for help, and she promised to do something for Maggie in return. These steps
helped Marissa begin to feel in control again, so she could see light at the end of the
tunnel.
Marissa’s example shows how to use an Action Plan when the evidence in our lives
mostly supports a distressing thought. We can also use Action Plans whenever we identify a problem that needs to be solved.
Vic: Making an Action Plan to improve his marriage.
Over time, Vic became more confident that Judy really did care about him and wanted
him to stay sober. However, Judy had been complaining for many years that she was
frustrated by his frequent angry outbursts. She also told him that she missed the nice
things he used to do for her early in their relationship. Vic loved Judy and agreed that
his anger was causing real problems in their marriage; he also admitted that he could be
kinder to her. He really wanted to improve their marriage, so he decided to make an
Action Plan, as shown in Figure 10.2 on pages 123–124.
Vic wrote down two goals that would improve his marriage. First, he would do
more positive things for Judy to show that he appreciated her. Second, he wanted to
stop his angry outbursts. Working with his therapist, Vic developed the Action Plan in
Figure 10.2 to help guide his progress. It is helpful to be specific on an Action Plan, in
order to get the most benefit from it. Vic set a time to begin working on his plan, anticipated problems that could interfere with his success, and created strategies for solving the
problems in order to keep moving forward on his Action Plan. Finally, the Action Plan
provided a place for Vic to record his progress.
Vic’s marriage improved once he began to increase his positive interactions with
Judy and reduce his angry outbursts. He actually used suggestions from the “Strategies to overcome problems” column on his Action Plan to help him through situations
that in previous weeks would have led to explosive anger. The specific coping plans for
handling his anger at different intensities, which he developed with his therapist, were
successful in reducing his outbursts.
Vic followed his Action Plan for a number of weeks until he learned to handle most
situations without losing his temper. When he did become enraged in the following
weeks, Vic used these setbacks to better understand his anger and to develop additional,
more effective plans for controlling and expressing it.

126 Mind Over Mood
Acceptance
When we can do something to solve a problem, then an Action Plan can help us figure
out what to do. Sometimes the problems we have cannot be solved. At other times,
we may experience life circumstances that are very difficult to endure, but they are
not problems we can work on solving with a Thought Record or an Action Plan. For
example, we may become very ill, someone close to us might die, or we might have a
task to do that is very unpleasant. In these cases, developing an attitude of acceptance can
help us cope and feel better.
Consider Lupe, who was diagnosed with brain cancer six months ago. At first Lupe
was in denial about the diagnosis. She frantically sought a second, a third, and even a
fourth opinion about her status and prognosis. The physicians she saw were consistent in
informing Lupe that there was little they could do, because the cancer was widespread
and had progressed beyond the point where treatment could help. Lupe was shocked,
then angry that she had cancer. Soon her anger was combined with fear. At 59 years of
age, she felt much too young to die, even though her doctors said her cancer was terminal.
It is easy to understand her reactions. Even so, about a month after receiving her
diagnosis, Lupe began to feel less angry and scared. She described her change in mood
to a friend this way: “I do not want to die. But if I am going to die soon, which seems
likely, I want to die with dignity. I am going to make these last few months as good and
meaningful as possible for myself, my family, and my friends.” Her new attitude helped
lift Lupe’s spirits and mood. She was still facing death, but acceptance of her illness made
it possible for her to focus on what was important to her in her final months. Once she
accepted that she had a terminal cancer, Lupe was able to think about how she wanted
to spend her remaining days. Lupe’s top priority was spending as much time as possible
with her family and friends in order to create memorable experiences with them. Acceptance was a turning point for Lupe. Acceptance helped lift her out of despair and focused
her attention on how she wanted to live her life.
Acceptance was also very important for Rodney, who visited his elderly father each
weekend. Rodney’s father had dementia and no longer recognized that Rodney was his
son. Each week when he visited, his father would ask, “Who are you? Do I know you?”
At first, Rodney would explain, “I’m your son. Don’t you recognize me?” His father
would become very agitated and upset when Rodney said this. Sometimes his father
would cry and say, “I don’t know you,” or “You are not my son!” It was very sad and
painful for Rodney to realize that his father no longer knew who he was. His pain and
sadness could have easily filled all his remaining time with his father.
A nurse at the care home helped Rodney develop acceptance. She told him, “Your
father does not know who you are. If you understand this and let him experience you
as a nice man who comes to visit him, then maybe you can still enjoy his company at
times.” Rodney considered this and decided to try to accept this new reality in his relationship with his father. When his father asked, “Who are you? Do I know you?,” Rodney would reply, “My name is Rodney. I like to come here and talk to people. Would
 New Thoughts, Action Plans, and Acceptance 127
it be OK if I talked to you today?” This satisfied his father and they would sit together,
talking and sometimes discussing events long ago in his father’s past. These conversations still included pain for Rodney, because he missed having a full relationship with
his father. Spending time together reminded him of many things he had lost from his
former relationship with his father, such as quick humor and animated sports discussions.
But Rodney discovered new pleasure in being able to show his father respect and to lift
his spirits through these weekly visits.
As Lupe’s and Rodney’s experiences demonstrate, acceptance does not mean that
we need to think positively about negative events or feel happy about things that we are
experiencing. Mind Over Mood and CBT do not suggest that it is a good idea simply to
substitute a positive thought for a negative thought. It would do Lupe no good to say,
“I don’t have cancer,” or “I don’t mind dying.” Instead, acceptance of negative circumstances and of painful moods can create a foundation on which to move forward in a
way that gives personal meaning to unhappy circumstances. Acceptance means that we
acknowledge the difficulties in life, come to our own way of understanding them, and
figure out how to live with them in ways consistent with our values and with what is
important to us.
These same ideas apply to everyday experiences that are much less dramatic. We do
many things that are unpleasant. We may wake up earlier than we would like in order
to go to work. If one of our children is sick, we may need to cancel social plans and stay
home. We accept these experiences because we have values that are more important to
us than our discomfort. We often put our own short-term needs on hold for our family,
our work, or other things we value.
The attitudes we hold while we are doing unpleasant activities have a big influence
on how we feel. For example, if every day when we wake up early to go to work, we
dwell on how tired we are and how we wish we were still in bed, then we are likely
to be in a bad mood. However, if we wake up early and say, “Oh, I’m tired and wish I
could sleep longer. But I’m so glad to have this job because it helps support my family,”
our mood is likely to be much better. Keeping in mind our values and what is important
to us can be a real help when we face difficult tasks.
Acceptance of thoughts and moods is sometimes a worthwhile alternative to identifying, evaluating, and changing thoughts. Acceptance involves observing your thoughts,
moods, and physical reactions without making judgments about them. For example,
many people find it helpful to be able simply to observe their thoughts as they appear and
as they disappear. Acceptance of your thoughts should not be confused with believing
that your thoughts are accurate or adaptive. Acceptance simply means that you recognize
these thoughts are present, and that you can observe them without adding any meaning
or judgment about them.
For example, Sal understood that an important step in learning to manage anxiety
was entering situations that made him anxious, in order to test his fears and practice
coping. At first, when he felt anxious in these situations, he negatively judged himself:
“What’s wrong with me? I’m so weak. I want this anxiety to go away.” In fact, such
thoughts led to an increase in Sal’s anxiety. Ironically, Sal discovered that one step to
128 Mind Over Mood
managing his anxiety was to accept this mood: “I’m feeling anxious now that I’m here.
Well, that is to be expected. I’ll stay in this situation and notice what happens to my
anxiety as I face it. I’ll try to understand my reactions, rather than push them away.” An
accepting, nonjudgmental attitude kept Sal’s focus on his thoughts and moods, as well as
on his goal to learn to manage anxiety in new and better ways.
As these examples show, there are several pathways to acceptance:
1. We can simply observe our thoughts and feelings without judging them or trying
to change them. This was Sal’s approach to his anxiety. As one woman said, “I can see
my thoughts and not be my thoughts.”
2. We can put our thoughts and feelings in perspective by thinking about the larger
picture. For example, Marissa’s supervisor had a habit of telling the staff, “Let’s be cheerful, ladies,” every morning. This annoyed all the staff because it seemed so phony, and
it was especially irritating to Marissa when she was depressed. Marissa found it helpful
to look at the big picture. When she dwelled on her irritation, her mood really suffered.
Marissa considered that this was just one minute out of each day, and thought about how
her supervisor was willing to help her keep her job. This big picture thinking helped
Marissa accept the irritating comment as a small price to pay for a supervisor who was
generally supportive and good to her.
3. Sometimes it is easier to accept internal reactions or external circumstances when
we connect our acceptance of thoughts and feelings to values that are important to us.
Rodney did this when he put his love and caring for his father above his distress that his
father no longer recognized him. Even though Rodney still experienced some distress
while sitting with his father, he did not let this stop him from spending time with him.
Rodney acknowledged his grief and sadness over his father’s declining health, and still
spent loving and caring time with him. Grief, love, and caring were each part of Rodney’s experience. Over time, the value of these hours spent with his father became more
meaningful, as Rodney was able to accept this time as a final phase in his relationship
with his father.
Exercise: Acceptance
Use Worksheet 10.3 to help you work toward acceptance of situations like the ones discussed
above.
129
Worksheet 10.3. Acceptance
Identify one external situation (e.g., family, work, health, relationship) in which you think developing greater
acceptance might be helpful. Consider situations that can’t be easily changed or solved. Alternatively, write
down some internal experiences (thoughts or moods) that recur often and negatively affect your mood.
Situation:
Thoughts:
Moods:
Try out one or more of the following paths to acceptance. It is not necessary to try each path for each situation,
thought, or mood. Over time, as you practice acceptance, you might want to try each of these approaches at
least once to see if they are helpful.
1. Observe your thoughts and moods (about the situation you have written down above) without judging, criticizing, or trying to change them. Just watch them as they occur. Be curious rather than critical. Try to make
these observations for a few minutes each day for a week. This is much more difficult than it may appear. It is
OK to notice if you become frustrated, distracted, bored, or judgmental. When you notice these things, just
gently turn your attention back to the original thoughts and moods that you are observing.
2. Think about the bigger picture. What are the benefits of accepting this rather than being distressed? Are
you focusing on only the negative parts of this experience and not recognizing other dimensions? Are there
aspects to the situation that counterbalance the negative parts? If you can accept the parts that distress you,
will you be able to enjoy or appreciate the rest of your experience more easily?
3. Sometimes paying too much attention to our distress prevents us from reaching our goals or living according to values that are important to us.
a. In this situation, is there some value or goal that is more important and meaningful to you than your
distress? If so, write that value or goal here:
b. Think about how important that value or goal is for you.
c. How can you use Mind Over Mood skills to help you manage your distressing situation, thought, or mood,
so you can approach or reach your values or goals?
d. Can you move in the direction of your values and goals while accepting the distress that you are experiencing?
Whether you followed the first, second, or third path to acceptance, write down what you have learned from
this exercise:

130 Mind Over Mood
In this chapter, you have learned and practiced three common steps that can be
taken after you identify and test thoughts connected to your moods: strengthening new
thoughts, using Action Plans, and developing acceptance. Which of these steps you take
depends a bit on the thoughts you are working on. Strengthening new thoughts by gathering more evidence is particularly helpful when you have a hard time believing alternative and balanced thoughts, even though these thoughts fit with your life experience.
Action Plans are an excellent next step when the evidence from your life experience
suggests that you have a real problem that needs to be solved. Acceptance is often the
best route if the problems you have cannot be solved, you are in the midst of difficulties
that you need to get through, or you want to put your distress in perspective so you can
move in the direction of what you value most. Often several of these steps can be used
in combination to help you develop a new perspective, so you feel more confident that
you can manage troubling situations and moods.
Mood Check-Up
Before going on to the next chapter, measure your moods again and write your scores
on the relevant score sheets.
• Depression/unhappiness: Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory

• Other moods/happiness: Measuring and Tracking My Moods

Goal Check-up
This is also a good time to review the goals you set on Worksheet 5.1 on page 34. By
keeping these goals in mind as you continue to practice Mind Over Mood skills, you are
likely to make progress toward them. You may also want to review Worksheet 5.4 on
page 37, Signs of Improvement, to see what changes you can already notice. You can
even make an Action Plan to outline steps you can take to reach your goals more rapidly.
 New Thoughts, Action Plans, and Acceptance 131
Chapter 10 Summary
X Initially, you may not fully believe your balanced or alternative thoughts.
X You can strengthen new balanced or alternative thoughts by gathering
evidence to support them. This is an ongoing process.
X As your belief in your balanced or alternative thoughts increases, your improved
mood will stabilize.
X Action Plans can help you solve problems that you’ve identified.
X Action Plans are specific and include actions to take, a time to begin, possible
problems with strategies to overcome them, and a written record of progress.
X Acceptance of thoughts and moods is sometimes a worthwhile alternative to
identifying, evaluating, and changing your thoughts.
X Developing an attitude of acceptance can help when you are in the midst of life
circumstances that can’t be changed or are difficult to endure.
X Three paths to acceptance are observing your thoughts and moods rather than
judging them, keeping the big picture in mind, and acting in accord with your
values even when you are distressed.

minutes before it was time to leave and would stand at the door, tapping his foot. Every
few minutes he would text her, asking Shauntelle if she knew what time it was and
reminding her that it was time to go. Shauntelle was equally upset and frustrated by
Trey’s reminders and could not understand why he was always in such a hurry.
In Chapters 6–9, you learned to use a Thought Record to identify and test automatic
thoughts – the thoughts that come into your mind automatically in specific situations.
In addition to automatic thoughts, we each have beliefs that run quietly beneath the
surface. We are often not aware of these thoughts, but they also have a strong influence
on our moods, our behavior, and our physical reactions. Because these thoughts usually operate below our awareness, we call them “underlying assumptions.” Underlying
assumptions are the rules we live by. Each of us has hundreds of underlying assumptions,
and each one can be stated as an “If . . . then . . . ” statement.
For example, Trey’s and Shauntelle’s reactions to getting ready for a party seem a
bit puzzling at first. Why did Trey continue to stand at the door and text reminders to
Shauntelle, when he could clearly see that this upset her? Why did Shauntelle wait so
long to get ready, when she knew that this irritated Trey? The underlying assumptions
Trey and Shauntelle held can help us make perfect sense of their responses.
Trey grew up in a family that valued punctuality and operated under the rule that
an invitation for a party or get-together at 7:00 meant that the guests were expected to
arrive at 7:00. In Trey’s family, arriving later than 7:00 was a sign of disrespect. Therefore, he held the underlying assumption “If we don’t arrive on time, then it will be disrespectful, and others will be upset with us.” However, in Shauntelle’s family, a party’s
starting time was viewed as somewhat of a suggestion. No one was expected to be there
Underlying Assumptions and Behavioral Experiments 133
at the starting time. In fact, in her family, arriving at the stated starting time was unexpected and would put pressure on the hosts, who most likely were still preparing for the
party. Shauntelle’s underlying assumption was “If we arrive on time, then it will pressure the hosts.” It is easy to see how each of their underlying assumptions guided their
behavior. However, since Trey and Shauntelle were not yet aware of these assumptions,
their conflicting assumptions guaranteed tension in their relationship.
Identifying our underlying assumptions provides a deeper understanding of the roots
of our behaviors and our automatic thoughts. Identifying our assumptions allows us the
opportunity to evaluate whether they are helpful or unhelpful, and gives us a chance to
look at the possibility of constructing new assumptions that may work better in our lives.
Unlike automatic thoughts, our underlying assumptions operate across many situations, guiding our actions and moods. Imagine that you are at a large family reunion.
One cousin walks around the room chatting with everyone, and another cousin sits
quietly in the corner and only speaks with those who approach and start a conversation.
What would lead to such different behaviors? It is easier to wander a crowd and talk
freely if you have underlying assumptions such as “If I talk to people, then I will have
more fun, because when I meet people they generally like me,” or even “If everyone
here is family, then we will have a lot to talk about and will enjoy each other’s company.” On the other hand, the quieter cousin may hold underlying assumptions such as
“If I begin a conversation, then I risk saying something wrong, so it is better to wait
until someone approaches me for a conversation,” or “If someone is elderly like me,
then younger family members should come and start a conversation with me to show
their respect.” Notice that many different underlying assumptions can explain the same
behavior. It is impossible to know what people’s underlying assumptions are just by looking at their behaviors or knowing their moods.
Luckily, even though they generally operate below the surface, underlying assumptions are easy to identify. Clues that assumptions may be present are situations in which
you find you always react with the same mood or do the same behavior. For example, if
you always are tidying up your home, then you probably have an underlying assumption
that you can figure out by putting your behavior in the “If . . . ” part of the sentence:
“If I keep the rooms at home tidy, then . . . ”. One person might finish this sentence this
way: “If I keep the rooms at home tidy, then my home will look nice if friends stop by
to chat.” Another person might believe: “If I keep the rooms at home tidy, then I will
be more relaxed and able to find things when I need them.”
Similarly, if you always react to being home alone on Saturday night with sadness,
then this is a clue that an underlying assumption is operating in the background. You
might be assuming, “If it is Saturday night, then I should be doing something fun. If I
am at home and not doing something fun, then this means I am a loser.” Someone who
holds a different underlying assumption may feel contentment instead of sadness: “If it
is Saturday night, then I can do whatever I want to do. Being home alone is a chance to
relax and have a nice quiet evening.”
Underlying assumptions are sometimes the most important level of thought to identify and test.
134 Mind Over Mood
• When we are anxious, many of our hottest thoughts are “If . . . then . . . ”
assumptions, such as these examples: “If I talk, then I’ll make a fool of myself,” “If
my heart beats fast, then it means I am having a heart attack,” or “If something
bad happens, then I can’t cope.”
• In our relationships, many misunderstandings come about because each person
holds different underlying assumptions. For instance, one partner may assume,
“If you care, then you will know what I want without me asking,” but the other
partner may assume, “If you want something, then you will let me know.”
• Behaviors that we do to extremes, such as alcohol or drug misuse, overeating, and
even perfectionism, are often driven by underlying assumptions: “If I drink, then
I’ll be more social,” “If I’ve had a hard day, then I deserve to eat a large dessert,”
or “If something isn’t perfect, then it is worthless.”
Underlying assumptions can be identified and tested just like automatic thoughts.
However, we don’t usually use a Thought Record (Chapters 6–9) for this purpose,
because Thought Records are designed to test thoughts in a single situation, and underlying assumptions apply across many situations. The ideal way to test an underlying
assumption is to do a series of behavioral experiments. Behavioral experiments are active
tests to see if the “If . . . then . . . ” rule predicts accurately what happens. There are many
types of behavioral experiments, such as doing the “If . . . ” part of our belief and seeing
whether the “then . . . ” part happens or not, trying out a new behavior to find out what
happens, or interviewing other people to find out if they hold the same assumptions we
do. This chapter teaches you how to identify underlying assumptions and test them with
behavioral experiments.
Linda: There is nothing to fear but fear itself.
As you will recall, when Linda’s heart began to beat rapidly, she got panicky because
she thought she was having a heart attack. When she completed a Thought Record (see
Figure 9.4 in Chapter 9, pp. 110–111), Linda’s alternative thought, based on the evidence
that she gathered, was that her racing heart and sweating were caused by anxiety and
not by a heart attack. Although her experiences supported this new idea, Linda did not
fully believe the new explanation of her symptoms. While sitting in her therapist’s office,
Linda was convinced that her bodily changes were merely symptoms of anxiety. But in
the middle of a panic attack outside her therapist’s office, Linda still believed that she
was dying of a heart attack when her heart raced and she began to sweat. Simply using
Thought Records was not enough, because Linda only fully believed the alternative
thoughts when she was not anxious.
When we have trouble believing an alternative thought even though the evidence
supports it, it is likely that our hot thought is fueled by an underlying assumption. In
Linda’s case, before she began therapy, she had this underlying assumption: “If your heart
is racing and you are sweating, then you are having a heart attack.” She and her therapist
Underlying Assumptions and Behavioral Experiments 135
developed an alternative underlying assumption: “If your heart is racing and you are
sweating, and your heart is healthy, then a racing heart is not dangerous.”
There was a lot of evidence to support this new underlying assumption that her
racing heart and sweating were not dangerous. When she went to the emergency room
during a panic attack, the doctors checked her heart and said that it was healthy and she
was not having a heart attack. She and her therapist discussed how the heart is a muscle,
and muscles get stronger when they are exercised. Linda did not think she was in danger
when she was exercising and her heart started to beat fast and she started to sweat. But
Linda still believed that her racing heart and sweating were signs of a heart attack if they
occurred when she was not exercising.
In order to test her new underlying assumption, “Even if my heart beats fast, then I’m
not in danger,” Linda and her therapist devised a series of behavioral experiments. First,
she and the therapist did a variety of experiments in the office in which she increased
her heart rate and sweating. By breathing rapidly or remembering a recent panic attack,
within a few minutes Linda was able to create all the symptoms that scared her. She and
her therapist did this multiple times and discussed her experiences. When she looked
at the written summary of these behavioral experiments done in her therapist’s office,
she saw that even when her heart rate was quite high for several minutes, her heartbeat
returned to normal within a brief period of time, she stopped sweating, and she felt calm.
This increased her confidence in her new assumption that a rapid heartbeat is not dangerous, but she was not sure how she would think about this outside her therapist’s office.
In a second series of experiments, Linda and her therapist decided that she would
purposely bring on these symptoms outside the office. On a daily basis, she would raise
her heart rate and sweating by breathing fast for a few minutes, and would then rate her
confidence that she was not having a heart attack. If she had thoughts like “I’m OK –
but if I breathe fast any longer, then I might have a heart attack,” she tested this idea
by breathing fast for a longer time. (Note: Linda had another physical exam before she
began her fast-breathing behavioral experiments, and her physician reconfirmed that
she did not have any heart problems and it was medically safe for her to breathe fast and
make her heart race, even though she didn’t always think she was safe.)
Next, her therapist encouraged Linda to imagine airplane flights from start to finish
until she raised her heart rate and began to sweat because of anxiety. These behavioral
experiments helped convince Linda that her imagination and anxiety could lead to her
increased heart rate and sweating. During these imaginary flights, Linda became more
firmly convinced that her physical symptoms were caused by anxiety instead of a heart
attack. Finally, she began scheduling the airplane flights she had been avoiding.
On the way to the airport for her flight, Linda hoped that her earlier behavioral
experiments would prevent her from feeling anxious. She was surprised to find that her
heart began beating wildly from the moment she left home on the morning of the flight.
Linda’s heart raced and she began to sweat. Linda reminded herself of all the times she
had felt this way when breathing fast or feeling anxious and how she had never had a
heart attack, even though she thought she would. To test the possibility that the symptoms on the way to the airport were anxiety and not a heart attack, Linda distracted
136 Mind Over Mood
herself from focusing on her body by concentrating on a report she needed to review
during the trip. After 10 minutes of concentration on the report, she noticed that her
heart rate had slowed. Since distraction can reduce anxiety but not a heart attack, Linda
began to breathe easier. She was not dying, just anxious.
Over the following months and after a number of airline trips, Linda found it easier
to fly. Occasionally she would still become anxious, especially when the plane encounAssumption Tested

tered turbulence. However, her panic attacks stopped when she gained confidence in
her new assumption that her symptoms indicated anxiety, not a heart attack. Figure 11.1
illustrates how Linda planned and charted two of her experiments, using the Experiments to Test an Underlying Assumption worksheet that is provided later in this chapter
(Worksheet 11.2).
Even after her anxiety became less frequent, Linda continued doing behavioral experiments to strengthen her belief that her symptoms were not dangerous, just uncomfortable. She occasionally let her racing heart continue for 10 or more minutes, to remind
herself that a racing heart was not dangerous. Linda knew she had conquered her anxiety
when she earned her first “frequent flyer” free airline ticket and was actually happy to be
able to schedule another flight – this time for a vacation!
Linda’s experiences provide several good guidelines for planning behavioral experiments:
Guidelines for Planning Behavioral Experiments
1. Write Down the Assumption You Are Testing
In the next part of this chapter, we provide some tips for how to choose an
assumption to test. As shown in Figure 11.1, Linda wrote down the new
underlying assumption she was testing: “If my heart races and I sweat,
then it is not dangerous, but instead is probably caused by breathing fast,
anxiety, or other factors.”
2. Make Specific Predictions
Make sure the experiments you plan will lead to new information that
will help you evaluate your assumption. One way to do this is to make
specific predictions of what either your old or new assumption tells
you will happen. Linda decided to breathe fast to raise her heart rate and
cause her to sweat. For a second experiment, she planned an imagination
exercise, which she thought would also lead to a racing heart and sweating. For both experiments, she predicted that her heart rate and sweating
would return to normal soon after the experiment was over.
3. Break Up Experiments into Small Steps
Small steps are easier to do, and what you learn in each small step can help
you take the bigger steps later. Linda began her behavioral experiments
in her therapist’s office by bringing on her symptoms with fast breathing.
Next, she practiced fast breathing at home to experiment without a therapist present. Finally, she began doing experiments in which her symptoms
were brought on by anxiety – first in imagination, then in actual airplane
flights. Her many experiences with a racing heart brought on by breathing fast (the first small step) helped her cope with a racing heart brought
on by anxiety (bigger step).
138 Mind Over Mood
4. Do a Number of Experiments
We usually need to do a number of experiments before we truly believe
a new way of thinking about things. Linda believed that her symptoms
were not dangerous when she was not anxious. But it took a number of
experiments and plane flights before she believed her new assumption (“A
racing heart can be caused by anxiety and is not dangerous”) not only
when she was calm, but also when she was anxious. Multiple experiments
also helped Linda become skilled at handling her anxiety, so that she
didn’t need to avoid situations in which she anticipated feeling anxious.
5. Problem Solve, Don’t Quit
When experiments don’t turn out as we hope, it is time to problem-solve,
not quit. It’s also a good idea to anticipate problems that might occur
before you begin doing experiments, so you can plan how to handle
these. In Figure 11.1 (on p. 136), Linda wrote these down in the “Possible problems” and “Strategies to overcome these problems” columns.
Because Linda had a surprisingly high degree of anxiety on her first plane
flight, she made some changes in her coping plan as she planned for her
second trip. First, she drank a glass of milk instead of coffee before leaving
for the airport. Second, she left a half hour earlier, so that she wouldn’t
need to rush and would have plenty of time to calm herself if anxious.
These two changes reduced two natural causes of increased heart rate
(caffeine and rushing). She also took a few minutes for relaxation before
leaving the house; this reduced her pre-airport heart rate, which made
it easier for her to cope with her anxiety. Even though it was important
that she experience a racing heart in order to test her assumptions, Linda
found it easier to approach situations that activated her anxiety when she
was not rushing and had the time to focus on her experiments.
6. Write Down Your Experiments and Their Outcomes
It is helpful to write down your experiments and their outcomes. Writing down your experiments makes it more likely that you will learn from
them. When Linda had taken flights before she began her formal experiments, she had just considered herself “lucky” if the flight went well, and
“a mental case” if she had a panic attack. By writing down her experiments, Linda was able to learn from both her good and bad experiences.

Linda’s efforts helped prepare her to cope with her first flight successfully. For her,
success did not mean having no anxiety; it meant knowing what to do when she felt
anxious. She was also successful because she strengthened her assumption that her rapid
heartbeat was not dangerous; it was caused by anxiety and not a heart attack.
Underlying Assumptions and Behavioral Experiments 139
Identifying Underlying Assumptions
Even though underlying assumptions lie “beneath the surface” they are easy to identify
if you know where to look. Since underlying assumptions guide our behaviors and emotional reactions, we know they are active when we want to change a behavior but find
it very difficult to do so, when we are avoiding something, and/or when we have strong
emotional reactions.
To identify your underlying assumptions in these circumstances, put the behavior
or the situation that triggers your reaction (avoidance or strong emotion) into a sentence
that begins with “If . . . ” and follow that by “then . . . ” – and let your mind complete
that sentence. It can also be helpful to write a sentence that says the opposite: “If I don’t
. . . then . . . ” Here are a few examples:
Rita: I can’t start my exercise plan.
Rita wants to exercise so she can lose weight, but she can’t figure out why she never
begins, even though she has the best intentions. She identifies her underlying assumption
by writing:
If I exercise to lose weight, then . . .
When Rita looks at this sentence, her mind quickly completes it like this:
If I exercise to lose weight, then I will just gain it back, so what’s the use?
She also considers what the “If I don’t . . . then . . . ” assumption might be:
If I don’t exercise to lose weight, then I won’t have to get up so early in the
morning.
These two assumptions help Rita understand why she hasn’t begun her exercise plan.
Derrick: I need it to be perfect.
Derrick is a perfectionist. He spends hours and hours working on a project at work, but
he never hands it in because “it could still be better.” What is his underlying assumption?
He figures it out by writing:
If I hand in my project before it is perfect, then . . .
After a few seconds of thought, Derrick completes his assumption this way:
140 Mind Over Mood
If I hand in my project before it is perfect, then I’ll get criticized, and my
manager won’t ever consider me for a promotion.
Kelly: I’m so ashamed.
Kelly doesn’t want people to know what is going on in her personal life, because she is
ashamed that she is unemployed and still single at age 35. This is something she accepts
about herself, so she is puzzled why she is so ashamed for others to know. Her underlying
assumptions help her figure this out:
If others know I am unemployed and single, then they will think I am
a loser, gossip about me, and post nasty comments on the internet.
If I don’t let them know I am unemployed and single, then I won’t feel
anxious, and I’ll have a better time.
You can’t really know what people’s underlying assumptions are just from looking at
their behavior or emotional reactions. For example, Derrick is perfectionistic because he
fears criticism. Other people may be perfectionistic because they take pleasure in doing
something better than anyone else and they hope for compliments. Only you know what
your underlying assumptions are.

and then complete the “then . . . ” part of the sentence. Do the same for the “If I don’t . . . ” part.

142 Mind Over Mood
Were you able to identify at least several assumptions in this exercise? If so, do your
assumptions help you better understand your behavior and your emotional reactions?
Underlying assumptions, just like automatic thoughts, can be tested and even changed.
Because underlying assumptions consist of “If . . . then . . . ” predictions, the best way
to test them is by doing behavioral experiments. One type of experiment is to do the
“If . . . ” part and see if the “then . . . ” part always follows. Another type of experiment
is to observe other people and see if your “If . . . then . . . ” rule applies to them. Sometimes we do the opposite of our underlying assumption to learn what happens when we
change our behavior. The following examples illustrate these three types of experiments.
Experiment 1: Does “Then . . . ” Always Follow “If . . . ”?
Mike experienced a lot of anxiety in social situations. When he was in work meetings,
he avoided eye contact, hoping that his supervisor wouldn’t call on him to speak. At
parties, he wanted to meet other people, but felt very shy and stayed on the edges of the
crowd, because he was afraid of looking or sounding foolish. He identified his underlying assumptions as these:
If I say something, then I will sound stupid, and people will laugh at me.
If I talk to someone new, then they will think I am boring.
Mike decided to do some experiments to test his assumption about sounding stupid
and people laughing at him. As shown in Figure 11.2, Mike decided to do one experiment three times. He wanted to start with a relatively easy experiment, so he planned
to talk about his weekend plans with store clerks when he did his shopping. Rather than
avoiding eye contact, he decided to look directly at each clerk to gather evidence of
whether the clerk was laughing at him or in any way negatively judging him. Mike predicted that at least two of the clerks would make fun of him or say something negative.
As shown in Figure 11.2, even though he was nervous, none of the clerks laughed
at Mike or said anything negative. In fact, two of them seemed to genuinely enjoy talking about the weekend with him. Mike was pleasantly surprised by these outcomes. His
prediction, “ . . . then I will sound stupid, and people will laugh at me or say something
negative,” did not come true. Instead, his experiments supported an alternative assumption: “If I talk to people, some of the time they seem genuinely interested, and they don’t
look like they are criticizing me.” Based on these results, he planned additional experiments at work and in other social situations to see if this new assumption predicted what
would occur most of the time.

often very tired, and her relationship with her daughter was becoming strained. With
her therapist’s prompting, Claudia identified the following underlying assumptions:

If what I do is not perfect, then I’m a failure.
If something is not perfect, then it’s worthless.
Her therapist encouraged Claudia to consider an experiment to test these assumptions and see if imperfection always led to failure or a sense of worthlessness. Claudia
couldn’t imagine attempting to do things less than perfectly. Her therapist suggested that
as a first step, Claudia could observe others doing things less than perfectly and see if her
rules applied to them. Claudia had no trouble spotting mistakes other people made, so
she thought this experiment would be easier.
In the beginning, Claudia found herself being critical of the other waitresses’ mistakes. But when she wrote down the outcomes of their mistakes on her Experiments to
Test an Underlying Assumption worksheet, Claudia noticed that her predictions did not
come true. The other waitresses did not seem to feel they were worthless; in fact, customers still gave good tips even after their mistakes. So evidently the customers thought
the waitresses’ service had worth, even if it was not perfect. None of the other waitresses
seemed to feel like failures after making errors; in fact, one of them just laughed about
it, as shown in Figure 11.3. This suggested that not everyone held the same assumptions
about being perfect. Even though she was not completely convinced, Claudia had to
admit that it was possible for people or activities to have some worth even when they
were less than perfect. This idea made Claudia more willing to do some experiments
where she did things less than perfectly.
Experiment 3: Do the Opposite and See What Happens
Gabriela constantly worried about her children. Whenever her oldest daughter, Angelina, went out with her teenage friends, Gabriela sat home worrying until her daughter
returned. She imagined her daughter getting into a car accident, being abducted, making poor choices, talking to strangers, or being the victim of a violent crime. Her constant worry kept Gabriela awake at night and distressed throughout the day.
When she put her worry into the “If . . . then . . . ” sentence, Gabriela identified
several assumptions she held:
If I worry, then I can anticipate bad things and protect my children.
If I don’t worry, then my children will be more vulnerable.
If I don’t worry, then I’m not being a good mother.
Although her assumptions made Gabriela’s worry look like a good thing, Gabriela was anxious all the time. She wondered if she could protect her children and be a
good mother without paying such a high price in distress and tension. For example, she

or worried. When she talked to her sister about this, her sister said, “I try not to worry
too much. Things I worried about in the past didn’t happen, and the bad things that
happened, I never thought to worry about! But I was able to handle them when they
happened. So I just try to take things as they come.”
After this discussion with her sister, Gabriela decided to do an experiment in which
she would do the opposite of worry, to see if worry was necessary to protect her children

or to be a good mother. She decided that the opposite of worry would be something that
helped her mind relax. Even better, she thought it would help to do something enjoyable and meaningful to her. When her daughter went out the next weekend, she decided
she would plan fun activities at home that would keep her mind engaged so she was less
likely to worry. She talked to the younger children about having a “game night” and
invited some neighbors over to join them. Gabriela put on music and made snacks to
help create a party atmosphere.
To get the most benefit out of her experiment, Gabriela filled out the Experiments
to Test an Underlying Assumption worksheet. As you can see in Figure 11.4, her predictions were “If I don’t worry, something bad will happen to Angelina. Whether something bad happens or not, I will feel like a terrible mother for not worrying.” Gabriela
recognized she might have difficulty stopping herself from worrying. She wrote this on
her worksheet, along with her plans to cope with any worried thoughts by bringing her
attention back to the games and focusing on the younger children and the fun they were
having.
Gabriela was successful in reducing her worry and enjoying the game night. Despite
her predictions, nothing bad happened to her daughter just because Gabriela worried
less. Instead of feeling like a bad mother, Gabriela actually felt proud of herself for being
able to have fun instead of being upset the whole evening. She concluded that worrying
every minute your children are gone is not a required part of being a good parent. In
fact, Gabriela began to think that she was a good mother, because she was available if
any of her children needed her, and she had spent some enjoyable time with her younger
children that night. She also realized that she had taught her children over the years how
to be responsible when they were on their own. She began to form a new underlying
assumption: “I don’t need to worry constantly to be a good mother. If I’ve taught my
children to make good choices and be safe, then that is part of being a good mother.”

148 Mind Over Mood
Exercise: Experiments to Test Your Underlying Assumptions
Earlier in this chapter, you identified a series of underlying assumptions that guide your behavior
(see pp. 140–141). Choose one of those assumptions that you think it would be helpful to test.
Think of what kind of experiment you would be willing to try to test your assumption:
1. Does “then . . . ” always follow “If . . . ”?
2. Observe others and see if your “If . . . then . . . ” rule applies to them.
3. Do the opposite and see what happens.
Or maybe you will think of a different type of experiment to test your assumption. For example,
instead of observing other people, you might decide to interview some close friends and find out
if they follow the same “If . . . then . . . ” rule as you do.
The important thing about experiments is that you either make observations or do something to test whether or not your underlying assumption’s predictions come true in a variety of
situations. In order to make a fair test, it’s usually best to do at least three behavioral experiments
before drawing a conclusion. So it is helpful to think of small experiments that are easy to do on
a daily basis.
On Worksheet 11.2, write the underlying assumption that you are testing at the top of three
copies of the worksheet. There are two additional copies of Worksheet 11.2 in the Appendix. In
the first column of each page, describe one of the experiments you plan to do. You might do the
same experiment three times or describe three different experiments on the three worksheets. In
the next column of each worksheet, write your predictions of what will happen, based on your
underlying assumption. Then identify any possible problems that might interfere with your doing
the experiment, as well as your plan for what you can do to overcome these problems.
Once you have completed these first four columns, do the experiments and write down in
as much detail as possible what actually happens, so you can compare these outcomes to your
predictions. Answer the following questions in the “Outcomes . . . ” column:
• What happened (compared to your predictions)?
• Do the outcomes match what you predicted?
• Did anything unexpected happen?
• If things didn’t turn out as you wanted, how well did you handle it?
After doing each experiment, write what you learned in the final column.

150 Mind Over Mood
In Chapter 9, you learned to develop an alternative thought to your original hot
thought after gathering and reviewing the evidence. In a similar way, after you do
experiments, you can see if an alternative assumption fits your experiences better than
your original assumption. For example, after Mike did his experiments talking to store
clerks (see Figure 11.2, p. 143), he wrote an alternative assumption: “If I talk to people,
some of the time they seem genuinely interested, and they don’t look like they are criticizing me.” When Claudia observed the other waitresses for her experiment (see Figure
11.3, p. 145), she concluded: “It is possible for something to be less than perfect and still
have worth. If I make a mistake, then it doesn’t mean I’m a failure.” Gabriela came up
with the following alternative assumption based on her experiment (see Figure 11.4,
p. 147): “I don’t need to worry constantly to be a good mother. If I’ve taught my children
to make good choices and be safe, then that is part of being a good mother.”
Once you have done your experiments, consider whether they support your underlying assumption or not. Look over your copies of Worksheet 11.2. If your predictions
did not all come true, try writing an alternative assumption that more closely matches
the outcomes of your experiments. You can write this alternative assumption at the bottom of Worksheet 11.2.
We often learn our original underlying assumptions from our families or from the
communities and cultures we grow up in. We are usually not fully aware of our assumptions, and it is often surprising to learn that not everyone operates under the same set of
rules.
Sometimes assumptions that once served a good purpose no longer work very well,
or they even act as barriers to positive changes we want to make. The good news is that
because assumptions are learned, we can learn new assumptions. Identifying our underlying assumptions and doing experiments to test them are steps than can help us discover
new assumptions – ones that can lead to meaningful change and greater happiness. Some
people spend a month or more testing out various assumptions they hold. Alternatively,
you can return to this chapter whenever you want to test out additional underlying
assumptions in your life.

Underlying Assumptions and Behavioral Experiments 151
Chapter 11 Summary
X Underlying assumptions are “If . . . then . . . ” beliefs that guide our behavior and
emotional reactions at a deeper level than automatic thoughts do.
X Underlying assumptions can be identified and tested, just as automatic
thoughts can.
X To identify underlying assumptions, put a behavior or situation that triggers
a strong emotion into a sentence that begins with “If . . . ”; follow that by
“then . . . ” and let your mind complete that sentence.
X Underlying assumptions can be tested by using behavioral experiments.
X There are many types of behavioral experiments, including doing the “If . . . ”
part of your assumptions and seeing if the “then . . . ” occurs, observing other
people to see if the rule applies to them, and trying the opposite behavior and
noticing what happens.
X It is usually necessary to do a number of behavioral experiments in order to
fairly test existing assumptions and to develop alternative assumptions that fit
your life experiences.
X Developing new underlying assumptions can lead to meaningful change and
greater happiness.

Core Beliefs

n many ways, automatic thoughts are similar to flowers and weeds in a garden. Thought
Records (Chapters 6–9), as well as Action Plans and acceptance (Chapter 10), are tools
that enable you to cut the weeds (negative automatic thoughts) at ground level from your
garden, making room for the flowers. With practice, these tools will work for you for
the rest of your life. Whenever the weeds flourish in your garden, you will know how
to cut them back. For many people, the skills learned in Chapters 1–10 are sufficient for
coping with problems effectively.
Other people find that even after they use these tools, there are still more weeds than
flowers, or that every time they get rid of one weed, two others take its place. In Chapter 11, you learned to identify underlying assumptions and test them with experiments.
When you discover that your assumptions are not accurate and discard them, this is like
pulling up the weeds by their roots. New assumptions can be planted and nurtured to
support more flowers in your garden. It often takes many weeks or months before you
can really believe new assumptions, so it is important that you spend whatever time is
necessary on Chapter 11 to strengthen your belief in your new assumptions. Usually
people will need to spend several months doing the experiments described in Chapter
11 before they have a high degree of confidence in new assumptions.
Many people notice a big mood improvement once they integrate and apply the
skills taught in the mood chapters (Chapters 13–15) and the earlier chapters of this book
(Chapters 1–11). It takes time and repeated practice for these skills to affect your life in
a meaningful way. Once you spend this time, the reward is that alternative thoughts and
assumptions will become your new automatic responses, and many areas of your life
may improve as a result. You may notice improvements in your moods, your relationships, and your overall sense of well-being. If this has been the case for you, this current
chapter is optional. Even if you decide you do not need to complete this entire chapter,
you may still find it interesting to read and complete the sections later in the chapter on
gratitude and acts of kindness (pp. 175–186), because these sections teach ways to boost
your positive moods.
 Core Beliefs 153
However, if you have spent the time needed to develop profi ciency with Thought
Records (Chapters 6–9), Action Plans and acceptance (Chapter 10), and experiments
(Chapter 11), and you are still struggling with your moods, then the solution may lie in
learning to identify and work with your “core beliefs.”
The following diagram illustrates the connections among three different levels
of thought: automatic thoughts, underlying assumptions, and core beliefs. Automatic
thoughts, which you have worked with in Chapters 6–9, are the easiest level to identify. Automatic thoughts are the parts of the weeds or fl owers that are above ground.
Automatic thoughts are rooted beneath the surface in underlying assumptions and core
beliefs. Notice that the arrows in the diagram go in each direction. This is because each
of the three levels is connected to the other two. Therefore, when you work on any
level of thought, you are also affecting the other two levels. This is why it makes sense
to work on the simpler levels (automatic thoughts and underlying assumptions) fi rst. For
a lot of people, once they change the top two levels, the core beliefs take care of themselves, and that is all they need to do to bring about enduring positive changes in mood.
Automatic Thoughts
Assumptions
Core Beliefs
Automatic thoughts can be described as words or images that come into our minds
automatically. As you learned in Chapter 11, underlying assumptions are not as obvious,
but you can identify them when you put a behavior or situation that triggers a strong
emotion into a sentence that begins with “If . . . ,” follow that by “then . . . ,” and let
your mind complete that sentence.
Core beliefs are all-or- nothing statements about yourself, others, or the world.
Marissa’s core beliefs about herself included “I’m worthless,” “I’m unlovable,” and “I’m
inadequate.” Her core beliefs about others included “Others are dangerous,” “People
will hurt you,” and “People are mean.” She also believed that “The world is full of
insurmountable problems.” All of these beliefs are “all-or- nothing” beliefs – there are
no qualifi cations. Marissa did not think, “I’m sometimes worthless”; she believed, “I am
worthless” (absolutely).
Everybody has both negative and positive core beliefs. This is normal. Our core
beliefs get activated when we experience strong moods or have life experiences that are
either very positive or negative. When we are feeling good, our positive core beliefs
are active (“I’m clever”). When we have negative moods, our negative core beliefs are
activated (“I’m stupid”). Once activated, our core beliefs affect how we see things, giv-
154 Mind Over Mood
ing rise to related (either positive or negative) automatic thoughts and assumptions. For
example, when we have positive moods and we make a mistake, we might think, “If I
make a mistake, I can fix it because I’m clever.” When we make the same mistake on
a day we are in a negative mood, we might think, “If I make a mistake, it shows how
stupid I am.”
Generally we work with automatic thoughts and underlying assumptions first,
because changes in these levels of thought occur more quickly and will usually lift our
moods. That is why Thought Records, Action Plans, acceptance, and experiments are
the best first steps to improve mood. When changes at the levels of automatic thoughts
and underlying assumptions don’t create the mood changes you hope for, this may be a
sign that your positive core beliefs are much weaker than your negative core beliefs and
need to be strengthened.
Just as you learned to identify and evaluate your automatic thoughts (Chapters 6–9)
and underlying assumptions (Chapter 11), you can learn to identify and evaluate your
core beliefs. If you have negative core beliefs that are active most of the time, then you
will usually want to identify and strengthen your positive core beliefs. Once your positive core beliefs are more active, you are likely to feel better and enjoy a more rewarding
life. For example, as long as Marissa saw herself as unlovable (a negative core belief), she
did not allow people to get to know her. She behaved in withdrawn and protective ways.
As Marissa developed a new positive core belief, “I am likable,” she was more willing to
get close to people. With this new belief, Marissa became more relaxed over time and
had more positive interactions with others.
Where do core beliefs come from? Very often we have had them since childhood.
We first learn about ourselves and the world from our family members and other people
around us. They teach us things like “The sky is blue. This is a dog. You are worthless.”
So many of the messages we are given are correct (“The sky is blue,” “This is a dog”)
that we believe all the things we are told, even things that may be wrong (“You are
worthless”).
Children also reach their own conclusions based on what they experience in life.
Some children may not be told, “You are worthless,” but they may notice that an older
child in the family is given special favors, that boys are valued more than girls, or that
athletic children are more popular than bookworms. They may make sense of these
experiences by deciding, “I’m not as good as [an older child, a boy, or an athletic child].”
Over time, this idea may be stored in their minds as “I’m no good,” “I’m defective,” or
“I’m a loser.”
Not all core beliefs are about ourselves. Based on experience, children acquire many
core beliefs such as “Dogs bite,” or “Dogs are friendly,” which guide their behavior (they
learn to stay away from or approach an unfamiliar dog). Children also learn rules from
other people around them (“Big boys don’t cry,” “Stoves are hot”).
The rules and beliefs a child develops are not necessarily true (e.g., boys and men of
all ages do cry), but a young child does not yet have the mental ability to think in more
flexible ways. Rules take on an absolute quality for a child. A three-year-old girl may
believe, “It’s bad to hit someone,” and be angry with her mother for hitting her brother
Core Beliefs 155
on the back when he is choking on a piece of food. An older child will be able to see the
difference between hitting to hurt and hitting to help.
In most areas of our lives, we develop more flexible rules and beliefs as we grow
older. We learn to approach dogs that are wagging their tails and avoid dogs that are
growling. We also learn that the same behavior can be “bad” or “good,” depending on
the context. However, some of our beliefs from childhood stay absolute even into adulthood.
Absolute beliefs may remain fixed if they develop from very traumatic circumstances, or if consistent early life experiences convince us that these beliefs are true even
as we grow older. For example, because Marissa was abused as a child, she concluded
that she was bad and that other people were dangerous. Young children tend to believe
that everything that happens is their responsibility. Therefore, even though no child
deserves to be abused, many abused children decide that the abuse is their fault and happens because they are bad. Unfortunately, these beliefs can continue well into adulthood,
especially when a person has no significant experiences that teach a different message.
Since Marissa was also physically abused in her relationships with both her husbands, her
original negative core beliefs became stronger over time.
Vic grew up with an older brother, Doug, who was a star athlete and straight-A
student. No matter how well Vic did in school and sports, he was never as successful
as Doug. Despite Vic’s own successes, he grew up with a core belief that he was inadequate. This belief seemed true to Vic because, in his own mind, no accomplishment
was worthwhile unless it was the absolute best (i.e., better than Doug’s achievements).
In Vic’s mind, this belief was supported when he heard parents, teachers, and coaches
describe Doug’s achievements with pride.
Because core beliefs help us make sense of our world beginning at a young age, it
may never occur to us to evaluate whether they are the most accurate or helpful ways
of understanding our adult experiences. Instead, as adults, we act, think, and feel as if
these beliefs are still 100% true. This is understandable, especially since some of our core
beliefs may have been accurate and helpful for us as children. For example, if we grow
up in abusive and alcoholic homes like Marissa’s home, it may be adaptive to view others
as dangerous and to remain constantly alert to signs of aggression. However, these same
core beliefs that helped protect Marissa in abusive relationships interfered with her ability to form close, trusting relationships with people who were not hurtful to her. With
a fixed core belief that “People are dangerous,” Marissa was at risk of misinterpreting
everyday behaviors as negative and aggressive.
It would help Marissa to develop new positive core beliefs – for example, that many
people are loving and kind. Developing this companion positive core belief would give
Marissa the mental flexibility to draw on the core belief that was most accurate and adaptive for the person she was with at any given time (“People are dangerous,” “People are
kind”). If we hold both types of core beliefs (positive and negative), then we are able to
experience our lives on a full continuum – from very negative to neutral to very positive.
When we hold only negative core beliefs, then every life experience becomes negative in
some way, because it is viewed through these negative, inflexible lenses.
156 Mind Over Mood
IDENTIFYING CORE BELIEFS: THE DOWNWARD ARROW TECHNIQUE
One way to identify core beliefs is called the “downward arrow technique.” In Chapter
7, you learned to ask questions about the meaning of events – such as “What does this
mean about me?” – to identify your automatic thoughts (refer to the Helpful Hints on
page 54). Once you identify automatic thoughts, you can ask yourself the same or similar
questions to help identify core beliefs. For example, you can ask yourself for any given
automatic thought, “If this is true, what does this mean about me?”
Sometimes repeatedly asking yourself, “What does this mean about me?” will help
reveal core beliefs about yourself that underlie automatic thoughts you have previously
identifi ed.
For example, if Marissa had the automatic thought “I don’t think Marsha likes me,”
and this thought contributed to her depressed mood, the downward arrow technique
would help her fi nd her core belief in this way:
I don’t think Marsha likes me.
(If this is true, what does this mean about me?)
Whenever I get close, people end up disliking me.
(If this is true, what does this mean about me?)
I’ll never have a close relationship.
(If this is true, what does this mean about me?)
I’m unlikable.
In this example of the downward arrow technique, the automatic thought (“I don’t
think Marsha likes me”) was about a particular situation. When Marissa identifi ed her
core belief related to her depressed mood (“I’m unlikable”), it was an absolute statement
that she believed was true for all situations in her life.
The preceding example illustrates how to identify core beliefs about oneself. We
also have core beliefs about others and the world. The downward arrow technique can
be used to identify core beliefs about others or the world by modifying the questions.
For example, beliefs about other people can be identifi ed with the downward arrow
technique by asking this question:
 Core Beliefs 157
“If this is true, what does this mean or say about other people?”
Assumptions or core beliefs about the world can be identifi ed by asking:
“If this is true, what does this say or mean about the world and how it works?”
Examples of using the downward arrow technique to identify core beliefs about others and the world follow:
situation: Vic and his colleagues received new sales quotas.
vic’s automatic thought: Everyone will be able to meet these quotas but me.
downward arrow:
(What does this say or mean about other people?)
They are able to do the work more easily than I am.
(If this is true, what does this say or mean about other people?)
Others are more competent than I am.
situation: Marissa is called in by her supervisor for an evaluation meeting.
Marissa’s automatic thought: I’ve made a mistake again. He’s going to fi re me.
downward arrow:
(What does this say or mean about the world and how it works?)
Bad things are always happening to me.
(If this is true, what does this say or mean about the world and how it works?)
The world is harsh and punishing.
(If this is true, what does this say or mean about the world and how it works?)
The world works against me.
158 Mind Over Mood
Sometimes identifying core beliefs about yourself will be enough to help you understand a recurrent problem in your life. Often, however, core beliefs about yourself tell
only part of the story. Identifying core beliefs about others and the world can complete
your understanding of why a situation is so distressing. For example, Vic would have
been less concerned about failing to meet the sales quota if he had thought others would
fail, too. Seeing other people as more competent than he was intensified his distress and
added to his perception that he was inadequate.
Marissa’s core beliefs that “The world is harsh and punishing,” and “The world
works against me,” certainly added to her depression and hopelessness. She had difficulty
putting forth effort day after day because of her belief that eventually the world would
crash down on her, despite her best efforts. In fact, it was a testimony to Marissa’s courage that she continued to work hard in her life, despite her beliefs about the world.
It is understandable that negative beliefs about the world may develop for people
who have witnessed or experienced trauma; have lived through harsh economic conditions without relief; have grown up in chaotic, unpredictable circumstances; have been
hurt by persistent discrimination; or have had life experiences of any kind that were
often harmful or punishing. Children who have these types of experiences seem particularly vulnerable to developing negative core beliefs about the world. Even so, powerful
negative experiences can help create negative core beliefs at any age.
Similarly, negative core beliefs about others usually develop from traumatic or persistently negative interactions with other people. Sometimes, as we have seen with Vic,
an indirect experience such as observing a highly successful sibling can help create a
view of others that causes distress. Vic’s positive view of others (“They are competent”),
linked with his negative core belief about himself (“I’m inadequate”), helped explain his
high level of anxiety.
It is important to remember that it is healthy to have both negative and positive core
beliefs. Negative core beliefs are only problems when they become fixed and we lose our
flexibility to see ourselves, others, and the world in positive ways. Similarly, positive core
beliefs can be problems if we lose the flexibility to perceive negative aspects of ourselves,
others, and the world. For example, if somebody is trying to take advantage of you, it is
helpful to be able to recognize this person’s negative intention. It is helpful to be aware
that some dogs do bite.
Several exercises follow (Worksheets 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4) to help you discover
some of your core beliefs. See if you can uncover core beliefs about yourself, others, and
the world that link to the types of difficulties you are working on as you use Mind Over
Mood. If you have difficulty identifying a core belief in one of these areas, it may mean
that the situations you have chosen do not involve this type of core belief. Worksheet
12.1 is a simple approach to identifying core beliefs. Worksheets 12.2, 12.3, and 12.4
are more detailed approaches that use the downward arrow technique. You can decide
which approach (simple or downward arrow) helps you identify your core beliefs most
easily.

Core Beliefs 163
Whatever the origins of the core beliefs that contribute to your distress, the next two
sections of this chapter teach you methods for changing them. For Marissa, a change in
core beliefs meant learning to see that the world was not always hard and punishing, and
that sometimes things did go her way. A belief that things could sometimes go her way
encouraged Marissa to begin to look for relationships and environments that she could
count on to be more consistently supportive. She then learned to use these supports to
help her cope with the harsher relationships and situations in her life. For Vic, a change
in core beliefs meant learning to feel good about himself even when he was not “the
best.” Vic also benefited from learning to see a middle ground between being “the best”
and being “a complete failure.”
Testing Core Beliefs
You might think that, just as we have used Thought Records to test automatic thoughts,
we can test core beliefs by gathering evidence that supports and doesn’t support the core
beliefs. This approach does not work so well for core beliefs, however. Because we see
our experiences through the lens of the core belief that is active, we often don’t notice
or believe experiences that don’t support this core belief.
Marissa, for example, believed that she was unlovable. When she tried to test this
idea, she did not value evidence like invitations to lunch from people at work, warm
greetings from several colleagues when she arrived at work, the love she received from
her children, or the high regard from some of her friends – even when they told her how
much they loved her. This was important evidence that Marissa was lovable, but Marissa
discounted it because she thought, “They were just feeling sorry for me,” or “They don’t
really know me yet.” When a core belief is active, we distort our experiences to fit the
belief.
Instead of testing our negative core beliefs, it is usually more helpful to (1) identify
new core beliefs that we would like to hold, and (2) look for evidence to support or
strengthen these new core beliefs. This offers the possibility of viewing our life experiences in fresh ways. If we find there is a lot of evidence to support our new core beliefs,
then we will begin to believe them. We do not need to get rid of our negative core beliefs.
When new core beliefs are as strong as our negative core beliefs, then we can be more
flexible in our thinking. Core beliefs that fit a given situation are more likely to be activated, instead of always understanding our experiences through our negative core beliefs.
Identifying New Core Beliefs
The advantage of identifying a new core belief (“I’m lovable”), as an alternative to trying to test and change a negative core belief (“I’m unlovable”), is that having a pair of
core beliefs allows us to become more flexible in our thinking and to understand experiences in ways that help us achieve greater satisfaction and happiness. If a single core
164 Mind Over Mood
belief is activated all the time, most of our experience gets viewed through the lens of
this core belief. When we have the balance of two core beliefs instead, an interesting
thing happens: With two core beliefs, we can evaluate our experiences more flexibly and
see which belief fits a situation better. Also, when we have two counterbalancing core
beliefs, we can better understand and accept a range of life experiences. For example,
when coworkers smiled at her, Marissa could accept and process this as a positive experience, without filtering it through her core beliefs of lovability or unlovability. She could
simply enjoy a nice interaction.
In addition to offering us greater flexibility in how we see things, identifying new
core beliefs allows us to remember positive experiences more easily. If we don’t have a
positive core belief, it is a bit like having a storage container with a hole in the bottom.
We can pour liquid (positive experiences) into the container and enjoy it for a short
time, but the liquid quickly drains away and is lost. Identifying a new core belief creates
a new container to store these positive experiences. Once we have a new core belief, we
can capture, store, and remember our positive experiences for a long time. This helps us
experience and hold onto greater happiness.
For example, if the negative core belief “I’m unlovable” is always activated, whatever happens is understood in those terms and stored in that container. Recall that even
when people appeared to like her, Marissa distorted her experience to fit them into her
“I’m unlovable” core belief (“They were just feeling sorry for me,” or “They don’t really
know me yet”). Because she was only viewing the world through the lens of her negative
core belief, she fitted all her experiences into the “I’m unlovable” container. If Marissa
created a new core belief, “I’m lovable,” she would have the option of using that belief to
understand and store experiences. Over time, as more and more experiences were stored
in the “I’m lovable” container, Marissa’s new core belief would grow stronger.
Sometimes a new core belief is the opposite of the initial core belief. For example,
Marissa shifted her belief from “I’m unlovable” to “I’m lovable.” This new belief did not
mean that she expected everyone to love her; it simply meant that she was lovable and
had many good qualities, whether people liked her or not. At other times, a new core
belief may change an absolute belief to a qualified belief. For example, Marissa shifted
her belief that “People will hurt me” to “Even though some people are hurtful, most
people are kind and giving.” At still other times, a new core belief may evaluate experience from a completely different perspective. For example, Vic shifted his belief that his
success and worth hinged on being “the best” to a belief that he was acceptable no matter
how well he performed.
Sometimes a new core belief will include a perspective of acceptance. For example,
you might choose to shift from a core belief of “People are unreliable” to one of “It is
OK if people are unreliable, because I am capable and can handle it.” In this instance, a
positive core belief about yourself helps you accept a negative core belief about others.
As shown in these examples, a new core belief does not always involve shifting to an
opposite word (for instance, from “unlovable” to “lovable”). It can shift to a new word,
as Marissa did in changing her view of others from “hurtful” to “kind and giving,” or
as Vic did in changing his core belief about himself from “worthless” to “acceptable.”

Once you identify new core beliefs, you will want to look for evidence to support
them, because it will take some time before you can believe these new core beliefs as
strongly as you currently believe your negative core beliefs. In the next section, you will
learn how to notice and create experiences, so you can begin to strengthen your new
core beliefs.

Exercise: Recording Evidence That Supports Your New Core Belief
At the top of Worksheet 12.6, write down your new core belief from Worksheet 12.5.
Over the next few weeks, notice and write down small events and experiences that support
your new core belief. Over the next few months, continue to look for and write down experiences
that support your new belief.
Keep in mind that the evidence you are looking for may be quite small. For example, evidence Marissa recorded for her lovability included people smiling and appearing happy to see her,
people asking her to spend time with them or agreeing to her invitations to spend time together,
and compliments given to her.

To notice these small events, ask yourself questions like these:
• Did you do anything today alone or with others that fi ts with this
new core belief?
• Did other people behave toward you in small or big ways that fi t
with this new core belief?
• Are there any habits you follow every day that fi t with this new
core belief?
• Did anything positive happen today that fi ts with this new core
belief?
Write down any experiences, no matter how small, that fi t with your
new core belief. If you fi nd yourself thinking, “This is so small or
unusual that it doesn’t count for anything,” write it down anyway.
The small experiences add up, and you want to make sure that you are
not discounting or ignoring any life experiences. Chances are that you
are highly aware of small negative events, so it is important for you to
become just as aware of small positive events.
To keep track of how your beliefs are changing, it is helpful to rate the your confi -
dence in your new belief on a scale similar to the one you used in Chapter 3 to rate your
moods. For example, when Marissa started looking at the belief that she was lovable, she
did not think it was true for her at all, so her lovability scale looked like this:
I’m lovable
0% 25% 50% 75% 100%
After she completed the Core Belief Record (Worksheet 12.6) for her new core
belief for 10 weeks, Marissa’s scale looked like this:
I’m lovable
0% 25% 50% 75% 100%
While this may look like a small change to you, it was very important to Marissa.
This was the fi rst time in her life that she had felt at all lovable. Even this small amount
of confi dence in her lovability allowed her to begin to experience love from her children
and friends. She kept track of small and large signs of her lovability for a year, and her
rating eventually reached 70%. As her new core belief became stronger, she began to
notice more and more positive experiences that had always been part of her life, but that
she had never really noticed or had discounted or distorted in the past. As she began to
notice and appreciate these positive experiences, Marissa felt greater joy and happiness in
herself and her relationships.

 Core Beliefs 169
As you record more experiences on Worksheets 12.6 and 12.7, and do the remaining exercises in this chapter, your new core belief will probably become more believable
to you. Confi dence in a new core belief usually takes months to develop, so don’t be
discouraged if your confi dence rating increases at a very slow pace – or even remains in
one spot for a long time. The more experiences you notice and write down to support
the new belief, the more likely it is that you will begin to have confi dence in it. With
this new confi dence, you may begin to feel better across many areas of your life. Over
time, it often gets easier to see more and more positive experiences, which can increase
your life satisfaction and happiness.
It is not necessary to be 100% confi dent in your new core belief. In fact, most people
begin to feel better when their confi dence in the new belief reaches a midpoint on the
scale. As you rate yourself on the scales in Worksheet 12.7, be sure to give yourself credit
for partial success and for progress.

This chapter introduces you to a variety of exercises that can help you
build new core beliefs so you can achieve greater happiness and life
satisfaction. Unlike the worksheets presented in earlier chapters, most
of the core belief worksheets (Worksheets 12.5–12.9) require you to
keep records for weeks or months to gather enough evidence to
strengthen your new core beliefs. Don’t expect to do all of these worksheets simultaneously. Work on one worksheet for a while, write down
what you learn, and then move to another one. The exception to this
rule is that it is helpful to do Worksheets 12.6 and 12.7 at the same
time.
Since you may be spending a number of weeks doing the worksheets in this chapter, remember to complete your mood measures
every week or two so you can track your progress. See page 150 for
Mood Check-Up instructions.
Vic: Using scales to rate positive changes in behavior.
Sometimes we can strengthen our new core beliefs more quickly if we practice new
behaviors or make changes consistent with our new core beliefs. For example, Vic
wanted to believe that he was acceptable, regardless of how well he did something. He
noticed that he felt badly when he “failed” at something or didn’t do a task perfectly. It
made sense to Vic that he should be able to feel acceptable about doing a task at work or
home less than perfectly. However, he was not so sure he shouldn’t feel guilty and unacceptable whenever he exploded in anger at his wife, Judy. He did not want to behave in
this way, and he knew that his anger was a problem, because his angry explosions were
destructive to his marriage and his self- esteem. Vic knew that if he could positively
change his angry behavior, he would begin to see himself as more acceptable. More
importantly, he was certain that changing it would improve his relationship with Judy.
170 Mind Over Mood
Vic set a goal to change his behavior when he was angry. He wanted to stay in
control of his behavior and not use threatening behaviors or words. Instead, he wanted
to stay connected with Judy and talk through disagreements in a respectful way. This
meant that he wanted to listen more to Judy even when they disagreed, and also express
his views assertively without putting her down. Because he tended to be perfectionistic,
Vic learned to use rating scales to reduce his perfectionism. For example, his therapist
taught Vic to rate his anger at work and at home on an “anger control” scale. The following scale shows how Vic rated his anger control in a conversation with Judy.
No control
over my angry
behavior
Perfect control
over my angry
behavior
0% 25% 50% 75% 100%
In the conversation, Vic became irritated and raised his voice several times. He even
pounded the table with his fi st once. But he did not criticize Judy, leave the house, or
behave in any way she considered threatening. He stayed on topic and took one threeminute timeout to cool down when his anger started to feel out of control.
Before learning to rate his experiences, Vic would have judged the conversation as
an anger control “failure,” because he was not perfectly in control all the time. Evaluating this experience as a “failure” would have discouraged Vic and perhaps added to his
hopelessness about learning to control his angry behavior. Using the scale shifted Vic’s
perspective. He was able to see that he was not a failure: He was 75% successful instead
of 0% successful. Even though he was very angry, he did not explode, withdraw, or hurt
Judy. He listened to what she had to say, and also talked to her about what was important
to him. Even when his anger built up, he was able to return to the conversation after a
three- minute timeout. For these reasons, he and Judy considered his efforts worthwhile,
even though he showed less than perfect control. Recognizing his partial success showed
Vic that he was making progress and helped him feel good about what he was doing
well.
Rating your experiences on a scale may be equally helpful in your life. If you have
changes you are trying to make, or experiences that you tend to discount or see as “failures” if they are not perfect, try rating them on a scale. See what difference it makes if
you focus on the partial positive aspects of the experience, instead of looking solely at
the negative aspects.
Use a scale to rate experiences you tend to see in “all-or- nothing” or
“success-or- failure” terms. Also use a scale to track your progress in
changing a behavior or mood. Notice how it feels to look at the positive
portion of the scale. Try to give yourself credit for any progress represented on the scale.

Exercise: Rating Behaviors on a Scale instead of in All-or-Nothing Terms
On Worksheet 12.8, identify some of your own behaviors related to your new core belief. For example,
if you are trying to develop a new core belief that you are lovable, you might rate your social behavior or things you do that you think would make you lovable. If you are trying to develop a new core
belief that “I am a worthwhile person,” you could focus on behaviors that you think demonstrate your
worth. Choose behaviors that you tend to evaluate in all-or-nothing terms. For each scale, describe the
situation and write what behavior you are rating. Notice how it feels to rate your behavior on a scale
instead of evaluating yourself in all-or-nothing terms. After you have rated several behaviors on these
scales, summarize what you have learned at the bottom of Worksheet 12.8. For example, Vic wrote, “I am
acceptable even when I have partial successes, because these are steps in the right direction. My efforts
to improve myself are a sign of acceptability, even though I am less than perfect.”

172 Mind Over Mood
Strengthening Core Beliefs with Behavioral Experiments
In Chapter 11, you learned to use behavioral experiments to test your underlying
assumptions. Behavioral experiments can also help strengthen new core beliefs. It is
hard to develop confidence in a new core belief just by thinking about it. Usually our
confidence in a new core belief increases only after we begin to experiment with new
behaviors that are linked to the new core belief. For example, Vic developed confidence
that he could control his anger only after he began experimenting with behaviors that
helped him stay in control.
One woman, Carla, saw herself as unacceptable and unimportant. Carla believed
that others were more important than she was, and therefore she always did what other
people wanted and put their needs above her own. She also avoided conflict in her
relationships, because she felt bad when others were upset with her. This was especially
true because whenever there was conflict, she assumed that it was her fault, and she felt
horrible. As she worked her way through the worksheets in this chapter, she decided she
wanted to build three new core beliefs: “My needs are also important,” “Conflict is normal in relationships, because different people often want different things,” and “If I stand
up for myself and tolerate my discomfort, I’ll feel better in the long run.” She decided to
do one or more of several behavioral experiments each day:
1. “I will pay attention to what I want and speak up for myself.”
2. “When I disagree with someone, I will express my point of view. I will tolerate
my discomfort and not compromise with someone else just to avoid conflict.”
3. “I will spend some time every day doing something for myself that is important
to me.”
Carla made predictions based on her old and new core beliefs about what would happen in these experiments. Her old core beliefs predicted that people would get upset or
criticize her when she did these things, and she would feel worse. Her new core beliefs
predicted that although there might be discomfort in the short term, she would feel better about herself in the long term.
Since Carla was especially concerned about what her closest friends and family
would think about her if she made these changes, she practiced her experiments the first
few weeks with strangers. Several things surprised Carla when she behaved in these ways
with shopkeepers, clerks, and new people she met. First, contrary to her predictions,
most of the time people did not even seem to react when she spoke up for herself and
made it clear what she wanted. Some people even responded favorably and said things
like “Oh, I can see what you mean.”
With these encouraging results, Carla decided to begin doing similar behavioral
experiments with family and friends. In these relationships, she sometimes received positive or neutral responses, but she noticed that certain family members got quite upset
with her when she asserted herself. When she continued to speak up for herself, Carla
Core Beliefs 173
was surprised that even though she felt discomfort at first, she sometimes felt a bit better
even when the disagreement continued. She was beginning to realize that it was OK to
express her needs, whether all family members agreed with her or not. Also, she recognized that she could be acceptable and expressing her needs was important, even when
others in her family did not agree with her.
As she thought about her experiments, Carla realized that some family members had
come to expect that she would always give in to their opinions and preferences. When
she did not, they reacted negatively. Therefore, she decided to talk to them and explain
that she wanted to be more direct in expressing her own wants and needs. It took some
time, but she gradually changed her role in her family. As Carla more regularly voiced
her opinions, she discovered that others often were willing to compromise and resolve
differences in ways that met her needs as well as their own.
These experiments required Carla to tolerate discomfort, especially in the beginning. She was pleasantly surprised to learn that her discomfort didn’t last, and that it
decreased as she did more and more experiments. Once she did her experiments, it
increased her confidence when people paid attention to her and went along with what
she wanted. When people did not respond to her requests, she was able to see that differences of opinion did not mean she was unimportant. She was able to understand that
conflict is a normal part of relationships, because even people who care about each other
often want different things.
Exercise: Behavioral Experiments to Strengthen New Core Beliefs
At this point, you may be ready to do some behavioral experiments to strengthen some of your
new core beliefs. Use Worksheet 12.9 to do the following:
1. Write out two or three new behaviors that are linked to your new core belief. You are likely
to feel a bit nervous or hesitant about doing these behaviors. That’s a sign that you are
probably on the right track.
2. Make predictions about what will happen, based on your old and new core beliefs.
3. If possible, try these behaviors out with strangers first (e.g., shop clerks, people in town
you don’t know). This can be helpful, because strangers don’t expect you to act in any
particular way.
4. Once you have done the experiments a number of times with strangers, try out these new
behaviors with people you know. If appropriate, you can tell your family and friends what
new behaviors you are trying and why this is important for you.
5. Write down the outcome of your experiments and what you learn from them, especially as
they relate to your new core beliefs and your predictions (see item 2 above). Do your new
behaviors and the outcomes support your new core beliefs even partially?

Core Beliefs 175
Gratitude
So far in this chapter, you have been working on identifying and strengthening new core
beliefs. You may recall that core beliefs come in pairs. Once you have both a positive and
a negative core belief, either one may be active in any given moment. You may be wondering if there is some way you can influence your mind so that your positive core beliefs
and positive moods are active more often than your negative core beliefs and moods.
Adding more gratitude to your life is one approach that can be a path to strengthening
positive core beliefs and moods.
A lot of recent research shows that an attitude of gratitude can lead to greater happiness, improvement in a variety of moods, and even improved physical well-being. It
is interesting to note that gratitude plays a role in every major religion. It seems that
gratitude can be considered a universal human value that cuts across cultures and has
been important throughout time. “Gratitude” means thinking about and being thankful for experiences or qualities in ourselves, other people, and the world. When we can
identify things to be grateful for or things we appreciate, we are more likely to have our
positive core beliefs activated and strengthened. Therefore, one thing each of us can do
to improve our mood is to develop a regular practice of gratitude. Gratitude provides a
pathway to recognizing and capturing positive experiences. When we follow this path
and cultivate this mindset, we tap into the better parts of our nature and experience
more positive moods.
Focusing on things we appreciate often results in a shift in perspective from negative to positive. Consider Louisa, who is having lunch with a friend. Louisa’s food is not
as hot as she would like, and the flavors are a bit disappointing to her. If she focuses on
these aspects of her experience, she is likely to experience a negative shift in her mood.
However, if Louisa is grateful that someone else has cooked lunch for her, that the food
is generally OK, and that she enjoys being with her friend and having a lively conversation, then Louisa is likely to experience a better mood.
Gratitude does not have to mean ignoring negative things. Louisa could ask the
restaurant to reheat her food or bring her something else. However Louisa chooses to
handle these and other negative aspects of her life, practicing gratitude means accepting
the negative aspects and actively looking beyond them to notice positive dimensions of
her experiences that she values.
The worksheets in this part of the chapter are designed to help you develop a practice of gratitude in your life. Some people experience the impact of this exercise immediately, and others may not notice any effects until they have used the worksheets for
several weeks. If this exercise is helpful for you, you may decide to develop the habit of
gratitude as a regular practice for the rest of your life.
176
Exercise: Beginning a Gratitude Journal
For the next six weeks, take five minutes once a week to focus your attention on things you are
grateful for. These may be small things like noticing the strength in your arms or the warmth of
the sun, or bigger things like experiencing the love of a child or even the election of a good leader.
Write these down on Worksheets 12.10, 12.11, and 12.12. Since you are only doing this exercise
once a week, it may be helpful to make a note on your calendar or in an electronic diary to remind
you to do it. If you run out of space on the worksheets provided in this book, continue in a paper
journal or in an electronic file.
As examples, here are some of the items Louisa wrote in her gratitude journal:
I live in a safe neighborhood. I appreciate that my neighbors know me and
wave when they see me. I enjoy watching the children play and hearing their
laughter. [World]
I enjoyed walking with my dog. She is always excited when I get out her leash to
walk her. It helps me after a hard day to know that she will be happy to see me.
She cuddles with me on the couch, and I enjoy petting her. [Others]
I took time to help my elderly neighbor. He was trimming some plants and
couldn’t reach the highest ones. I value helping others, and it made me feel
good to do something kind without expecting anything in return. I actually
enjoyed doing it. I also felt happy that his mood seemed to lift because I was
there, and that we had a nice chat while we worked together. [Myself]
Use the categories in Worksheets 12.10–12.12 to help you. These ask you to think about gratitude
in three areas linked to the core beliefs you have been working on in this chapter: the world and
your life, other people, and yourself. Notice things you are grateful for, review what you’ve already
written, and add new items to these gratitude worksheets each week.
As in Louisa’s example above, it is more helpful to write about a few things in depth than to
try to make a long list of things you are grateful for. So try writing about a few things in detail each
week, even if it is just one item per worksheet. Some weeks you might write about several items
on one or two worksheets instead of on all three worksheets. This is also OK.
Remember to use these three worksheets for at least six weeks (Worksheets 12.10, 12.11, and
12.12). Then, after filling them out for six weeks, answer the questions in Worksheet 12.13.

Core Beliefs 181
If your gratitude journal has helped boost your positive moods, you may choose to
continue writing in this journal after six weeks. The advantage of a written journal is
that you can read and review what makes you grateful on days when your mood is a bit
low, and this can help you feel better. Some people prefer simply to think about what
makes them grateful, and if this is helpful for you, that is also OK.
Expressing Gratitude to Others
Most people find genuine benefits in keeping a gratitude journal. Being aware of things
in our lives for which we can be grateful is an important step. Sometimes it can have
added value if we express our gratitude to others. There are several potential advantages
to expressing our gratitude to other people. First, it gives us more time to focus on gratitude, because it extends the moment of gratitude. Second, when we talk about the things
we feel grateful about to others, they may tell us about things that make them grateful.
This can lead to more positive conversations, which can help lift our mood. Third, telling people directly that we are grateful to them for something they have done, or just for
being in our lives, may deepen our gratitude experience and improve our relationships.
Having more positive relationships with other people is another pathway to happiness. In
general, expressions of gratitude keep us in a more positive frame of mind.
182
Exercise: Expressing Gratitude to Others
Therefore, as you continue to keep your weekly gratitude journal, look over what you have written and consider which of these things you could express to other people. There are two different
kinds of gratitude you might express to others. First, you can comment (even to strangers) about
things you appreciate in the world and your life (Worksheet 12.10). For example, “I feel so lucky we
are having nice weather today when other people are experiencing those bad storms.” Second,
you can look over your Gratitude about Others worksheet (Worksheet 12.11) and choose someone
in your life you have written about there. Then either talk directly to this person or write the person a letter/email to express gratitude. Take some time to think through the ways this person has
positively affected your life. You can write about what you appreciate in letter form, even though
you may or may not choose to send the person what you have written.
If you do decide to tell someone about how you appreciate her or him, there are many ways
to do this: face to face, over the telephone, or in an appreciation letter. You could even visit the
person to read a letter or to talk about how you feel.
Write down which people you expressed gratitude to and what happened as a result. Here
are some of Louisa’s examples:
I thanked the shop clerk for being so helpful in finding me the shampoo I was
looking for.
What happened?
She seemed really pleased that I appreciated her help. I felt good for cheering
her up with such a small thing.
I mentioned during lunch break that I appreciated our nice weather.
What happened?
This got everyone talking about fun things they planned to do outdoors this
weekend. It was a more positive conversation than we usually have at lunchtime.
I wrote a letter to the woman who was my piano teacher years ago. I told her how
much I still enjoy playing the piano, and I thanked her for her patience and
kindness to me.
What happened?
I felt a lot of positive emotion as I was writing the letter. I haven’t heard back
from her, but I imagine it brightened her day to get this unexpected letter.
Worksheet 12.14 provides a place for you to write down any expressions of gratitude you make
and what happens. Be sure to notice any effects these have on your mood, other people, and/or
your relationships. Sometimes the effects may be quick and in the moment; at other times, the
effects may be more lasting.

184 Mind Over Mood
Acts of Kindness
In addition to being grateful for the positives in our lives, another way to activate and
support our new positive core beliefs is to do kind things for other people. When we are
kind to others, we often experience a mood boost and greater happiness. In one study,
people who performed kind acts toward others every day for four weeks felt happier and
more satisfied with their relationships. The types of kind acts that led to these changes
included small things like opening the door for someone, buying lunch for a friend,
smiling at a stranger, letting someone go ahead in a line, visiting an ill friend, giving a
compliment, and helping a neighbor with shopping or home repairs. When we do these
kind acts toward others, we tend to feel better about ourselves, more positively connected to other people, and happier over time.
Christine did an experiment with acts of kindness. When she began going to a new
post office, she noticed that everyone there seemed unhappy and irritable about waiting
for service. She decided to take each visit as an opportunity to smile at people, greet the
clerks warmly, and engage others in line with pleasant conversation. After a few weeks,
she noticed that the postal clerks greeted her with a warm smile when she arrived. This
warmth extended to other customers. Over time, the post office became a place of good
humor, friendliness, and smiles rather than unhappiness. Christine’s experiences demonstrate an important idea: Acts of kindness help others feel better as well as ourselves.
They also can help transform the places we go into opportunities for improved mood
and positive connection with others.
185
Exercise: Doing Acts of Kindness
For the next several weeks, plan to do regular acts of kindness. These can be small things that
you do for family, friends, coworkers, neighbors, strangers, or animals. Write down what you do
on Worksheet 12.15. After several weeks, you can write at the bottom of the worksheet what you
notice about the effects of these acts on your mood and relationships. Also, notice if your positive
core beliefs about yourself, other people, or the world are activated when you do these kind acts.

186 Mind Over Mood
The learning experiences in this chapter plant the seeds for new positive core beliefs.
Positive core beliefs help you feel happier, and as they become stronger, you will have
fewer negative automatic thoughts. However, there may still be times in your life when
you feel greater levels of depression, anxiety, anger, or other distressing moods. During
times of distress, negative thoughts and negative core beliefs may return. At those times, it
is helpful to review the worksheets you have completed throughout this book, especially
your new positive core belief records and ratings (Worksheets 12.6 and 12.7), your gratitude journal (Worksheets 12.10–12.12), and records of your expressions of gratitude to
others and acts of kindness (Worksheets 12.14 and 12.15). During difficult times, it can be
helpful to resume exercises that have been helpful in the past. Even better, see how many
of these helpful practices you can make a daily part of your life. Over time, these may
become familiar habits to you, and you may notice that you automatically notice positive
experiences, feel and express gratitude, and act on opportunities to be kind to others.
Mood Check-Up
Use the same measures and worksheets to mark your mood scores as you used before:
• Depression/unhappiness: Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory
Worksheet 13.1, page 191, and Worksheet 13.2, page 192
• Anxiety/nervousness: Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory
Worksheet 14.1, page 221, and Worksheet 14.2, page 222
• Other moods/happiness: Measuring and Tracking My Moods
Worksheet 15.1, page 253, and Worksheet 15.2, page 254
It is especially important to rate your happiness, as many of the exercises in this
chapter are likely to affect your level of happiness.
What to Do Next?
Since there are many different orders to read the chapters in Mind Over Mood, by the
time you finish this chapter, you may have read almost the entire book. If you have
reached your goals and feel better now, this is a good time to proceed to Chapter 16,
Maintaining Your Gains and Experiencing More Happiness.
If you have been working on one mood and still struggle with it or other moods,
this is a good time to review the relevant mood chapters (Chapter 13 for depression;
Chapter 14 for anxiety; and Chapter 15 for anger, guilt, and shame). These mood chapters guide you to the Mind Over Mood skills most helpful for each mood.
Even if your moods have improved, if you have not yet read all the chapters in this
book and want to learn additional skills, this is a good time to read those remaining
chapters.
Core Beliefs 187
Chapter 12 Summary
X If you are still struggling with your moods after practice with Thought Records
(Chapters 6–9), Action Plans (Chapter 10), and behavioral experiments (Chapter
11), then you may need to identify and work with core beliefs.
X Core beliefs are all-or-nothing statements about ourselves, other people, or the
world.
X Core beliefs are the roots of our underlying assumptions and automatic
thoughts.
X Core beliefs come in pairs. When we have negative core beliefs that are active
most of the time, it is helpful to identify and strengthen new positive core
beliefs.
X Core beliefs can be identified either by using the downward arrow technique or
by completing the sentences “I am . . . ,” “Other people are . . . ,” and “The world
is . . . ”.
X New positive core beliefs can be strengthened by recording experiences
that are consistent with the new core belief, rating your confidence in your
new belief, rating behaviors linked to the new core beliefs, and conducting
behavioral experiments to try out the new belief.
X Core beliefs shift gradually, but over time they become stronger and more
stable, and they exert a powerful influence over the way we think, behave, and
feel.
X Keeping a gratitude journal and expressing gratitude can strengthen our
positive core beliefs and lead to greater happiness.
X Performing acts of kindness can increase our happiness and improve our
relationships.

Understanding
Your Depression
I
f you are reading this chapter early in your use of Mind Over Mood, it is probably
because you are feeling depressed. Throughout this book, you learn about ways to
help depression by following the stories of Ben, Vic, and Marissa. Each of them became
depressed in a different way.
Ben lived for most of his life without ever being seriously depressed. Ben’s depression began during a hard year in which one of his best friends died and his wife, Sylvie,
was diagnosed with cancer. Even though Sylvie’s treatment went well and she recovered
fully, Ben began to feel discouraged and hopeless about his future, and to have more and
more negative thoughts about himself and his activities. Over time, he lost his appetite,
stopped doing things he enjoyed, and some days found it hard even to get out of bed.
Ben’s depression started out slowly and gradually grew and grew until it put a dark veil
over each day.
Vic, on the other hand, had experienced a sense of worthlessness and low self-esteem
since childhood. Most of his life he had struggled with alcoholism, but he had been able
to stay sober for most of the last few years with the support of his wife and AA. Vic was
never totally knocked down with depression. Instead, most of the time he had a low level
of depression, which mostly consisted of self-doubt and a sense that he was inadequate.
Marissa had experienced serious depression many times throughout her life. She had
been sexually abused by her father as a young child, and was later abused by two different
husbands. When Marissa’s depression was especially severe, she struggled with impulses
to hurt herself, and she even made two suicide attempts. She learned to think about herself negatively at an early age. Her depression was quite disruptive to her life and made
Understanding Your Depression 189
it difficult for her to concentrate at work. Sometimes her depression was so bad that she
showed up late to work and had trouble concentrating when she was there; as a result,
she was in danger of losing her job.
As these three people illustrate, depression can have different faces: It can start fast
or slow, can be mild or severe, may happen once or many times throughout life, or may
even be always present in the background. Think about your own depression:
Did it start fast, or slowly build over time?
Does it have a mild, moderate, or severe impact on your life?
Is this the first time you have felt this way, have you felt this way before, or has depression
been with you most of your life?
Whatever your answers are to these questions, this chapter will help you understand
your depression and begin to take the first steps toward feeling better.
Identifying and Assessing Symptoms of Depression
Although emotions generally enrich our lives, too much emotion can be disruptive.
When we are sad about something, it can help us understand what is important to us and
gives our lives meaning. For example, if we are dating someone we like and the relationship ends, we usually feel sad. Our sadness helps us realize how important this person
was to us and how much we wanted the relationship to continue. These emotions lead
us to think about what went wrong and what we could do differently next time to help
our relationships succeed. However, if after a relationship breakup our sadness develops
into depression, we may begin to feel unlovable and hopeless that anyone will ever care
for us again. We may begin to stay in bed and avoid contact with other people. At the
extremes, our emotions can disrupt our lives and actually make things worse.
Everyone experiences depression a bit differently. Therefore, a first step toward
understanding your depression is to rate how often you experience particular symptoms
that often occur with depression. Many people find it interesting to learn that these varied experiences all can be part of depression. Of course, if we are not severely depressed,
we may only experience a few of these symptoms occasionally. But when depression gets
worse, it is common to have many of these signs of depression active nearly every day.
190
Exercise: Measuring Symptoms of Depression
To track the symptoms of depression you are experiencing, rate each item listed on the Mind
Over Mood Depression Inventory (Worksheet 13.1). Fill out this inventory periodically as you use
this book, to assess how your depression is changing and which Mind Over Mood skills are most
worthwhile.
Score the inventory by adding up the numbers you circled or marked for all the items. For
example, if you circled or marked 3 for each item, your score would be 57 (3 × 19 items). If you
couldn’t decide between two numbers for an item and circled or marked both, add only the
higher number. Compare your scores once or twice each week, to see if any of your symptoms are
decreasing (and, if so, which symptoms are decreasing and which are not).
Record your progress on Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory scores on Worksheet 13.2.
Mark each column at the bottom with the date you completed the Depression Inventory. Then
put an × in the column across from your score. It is best to fill out the inventory at fairly regular
intervals, such as weekly or twice a month, rather than just filling it out when you feel particularly
down. That way, the graph of your scores will be a more representative snapshot of your mood
over time.
You may find that your scores fluctuate from week to week, or that they do not improve each
and every time you fill out the inventory. Some weeks your score may be higher (more depressed)
than the week before. This is not unusual, nor is it a bad sign; in fact, it reflects a pattern of recovery experienced by some people. A general pattern of decreasing scores over time is a sign that
the changes you are making are contributing to your improvement.
Two different decreasing patterns are shown in the Epilogue of this book (Figures E.1 and E.2,
pp. 293 and 294) for Ben and Marissa. If your scores keep going up or don’t change at all over a
six-week period, even though you are doing the exercises in this book, this can be a signal that you
might need to try a different approach or get help from a health care professional.

 Understanding Your depression 193
Again, the Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory and its score sheet (Worksheets
13.1 and 13.2) are tools you can fi ll out periodically (e.g., weekly or twice a month) to
track changes in your mood. The fi rst time you complete the inventory, you get your
baseline or starting score. You may notice changes in your scores (improvement or worsening) over time and as you try different strategies to improve your mood. For example,
you might start exercising, take steps to solve a problem that has been bothering you,
begin taking medication, or enroll in cognitive- behavioral therapy (CBT). With each of
these interventions, you would hope and expect that your depression symptoms would
go down, resulting in lower Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory scores. This is one
way to measure the helpfulness of different approaches you try.
Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory scores are not used to diagnose depression. If
you believe you are depressed, you can bring your completed Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory to a health care provider or mental health professional. Your answers
on the inventory can help you tell this person about your experiences, so he or she can
determine a diagnosis and discuss available treatments with you.
The symptoms you rate on the Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory are cognitive
(thought), behavioral, emotional, and physical changes, just as in the model described in
Chapter 2. Notice that cognitive symptoms of depression include self- criticism, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts, diffi culty concentrating, and negative thoughts. Common
behavior changes associated with depression include withdrawal from other people, not
doing as many activities that are enjoyable or pleasurable, and having diffi culty “getting
started” with activities. Physical symptoms include insomnia, sleeping more or less than
usual, being tired, eating less or more, and weight change. The emotional symptoms
of depression can include feelings of sadness, irritability, anger, guilt, and nervousness.

194 Mind Over Mood
Does it surprise you to learn that some of these symptoms are characteristic of
depression? Some people don’t realize that problems with sleep, appetite, motivation,
concentration, or anger can be part of depression. But for many people, successful treatment of depression leads to improvement in all these symptoms.
Thoughts and Depression
Aaron T. Beck has pioneered our modern understanding of depression. In the 1960s,
Beck demonstrated that depression was characterized by thought patterns that actually
maintained depressed mood. For example, Beck noted that when we are depressed, we
have negative thoughts about ourselves (self-criticism), our experiences (general negativity), and our future (hopelessness). The following sections describe these three aspects
of depressed thinking in detail.
Negative Thoughts about Myself
Before Marissa began CBT, she was extremely self-critical. For example, she thought,
“These awful things happened to me because I’m bad,” “I’m an awful mother and a terrible person,” and “It’s my own fault that I was beaten by my husbands.” The themes
underlying these thoughts were “I’m worthless,” “I’m unlovable,” and “I’m no good.”
Almost everyone who is depressed has self-critical thoughts. These thoughts are
damaging because they contribute to low self-esteem, low self-confidence, and relationship problems, and because they can interfere with our willingness to do things to help
us feel better.
To demonstrate how self-criticism plays a role in your life, remember a time when
you felt particularly low. It may have been a time when you felt worthless or unlovable.
Picture in your mind the moment you were feeling most depressed, and remember or
guess what you may have been thinking. Did you have any negative thoughts about
yourself? If so, write them here:
These thoughts illustrate the self-critical thoughts associated with depression.
Understanding Your Depression 195
Negative Thoughts about My Life Experiences
Thinking about your current experiences in a negative way is another characteristic of
depressive thinking. We often do not take events at face value: We interpret or misinterpret events that occur around us. For example, when a friend, relative, or coworker is
talking, we might think that this person is negative, mean, or critical, even though we
might not see it that way when we are not depressed.
Negative thinking about our experiences is also a style of thinking in which we
notice and remember negative aspects of our lives more vividly than positive or neutral
ones. For example, when we are depressed, we tend to look at and remember the negative things that happened during the day and not the positive ones. Focusing on the two
out of ten chores that did not get done on a Saturday, rather than the eight that did get
done, would be another example of negative thinking about our experiences.
Think about a recent time when you felt particularly depressed. Write down any
examples of thoughts you had in which you either (1) focused on the negative and
ignored the positive, or (2) interpreted events in a negative way.
Negative Thoughts about My Future
During his first therapy session, Ben’s hopelessness was revealed in this statement: “What’s
the use? The rest of my life will be filled with illness and death.” After his wife’s successful battle with cancer and the death of his good friend Louie, Ben had come to believe
that his own life and the lives of people he was close to would be one tragedy after
another, culminating eventually in his own death. He was unable to envision anything
other than a bleak future.
When we are depressed, we imagine that the future will be very negative. This
prediction or anticipation that events will turn out negatively is called “hopelessness.”
Examples of this type of thinking include “I’ll blow it,” “Nobody there will like me,”
196 Mind Over Mood
and “I won’t be good at it.” A negative attitude toward the future may also manifest itself
in thoughts like “I’ll never get out of this depression,” or “What’s the use in trying? I’ll
never get any better.” We may anticipate that a conversation will go poorly, that a new
relationship won’t work out, that a problem can’t be solved, or that there is no way out
of your depression. In its most extreme form, hopelessness can contribute to thoughts of
suicide.
To demonstrate how negative thinking about the future functions in your life, write
down some of the negative predictions you make about your future. For example, you
may identify an activity you sometimes enjoy but do not do when you are depressed,
because you predict it will not turn out well.

Treatment for Depression
The good news is that depression can almost always be helped. Most of the strategies
taught in this book were originally developed to help people overcome depression. This
section summarizes the treatment approaches that have been shown to be most effective: cognitive therapy, medication, improving relationships, and behavioral activation.
Research suggests that behavioral activation and cognitive therapy are two of the most
effective methods for helping people get better and stay better. Together, these two
Understanding Your Depression 199
approaches are often referred to as CBT. Although we describe cognitive and behavioral
approaches separately, you will learn to use them simultaneously. As with other skills, it
is helpful to learn to use them one at a time and combine them once you feel confident
in using each. Because they are so effective, we emphasize these two approaches in this
chapter and the other chapters of this book.
People who take medication alone are at greater risk for future relapse than people
who combine medication with cognitive and behavioral interventions. If you have been
prescribed medication for your depression, learning Mind Over Mood skills can help you
minimize the likelihood that you will get depressed again once you get better and stop
taking your medication.
The following sections describe each type of intervention for depression. If you are
depressed, it is often best to start with behavioral activation. We want you to read an
overview of all these methods first. We describe behavioral activation last, so that when
you get to that section, you can do the exercises described there for a few weeks before
proceeding to other chapters of this book.
Cognitive Therapy
When we are depressed, we tend to notice and remember the negative aspects of our
experiences more readily than we do the positive or neutral aspects. We also are more
likely to interpret events in our lives with a negative bias when we are depressed. When
we are not depressed, we tend to interpret events with a positive bias. For example, suppose you invite three people to join you for lunch, and two agree to come. If you are
depressed, you will tend to focus on the one person who didn’t come and maybe even
conclude, “No one likes me.” If you are not depressed, you are more likely to think,
“Most people like me. The one who couldn’t come to lunch might have had other plans
but they missed out on a good time.”
Cognitive therapy teaches people how to identify, test, and perhaps change their
negative thoughts by reviewing all the information in their lives – positive and neutral as
well as negative. Chapters 6–9 and 11–12 teach you how to think in more adaptive ways
to reduce your depression. As you might imagine, this book is called Mind Over Mood
because many of the chapters show you how to make changes in your thinking that will
help you feel better.
Medication
Although medication can sometimes help depression, not everyone who is depressed
will benefit from it. Your therapist or another health care provider may recommend a
consultation with a psychiatrist or another physician who can evaluate whether or not
medication might be helpful for you. Some people worry about the effects of antidepressant medication. Some of the most common concerns are addressed here.
200 Mind Over Mood
“How Do I Know If Medication Will Help?”
There can be a trial-and-error process to prescribing antidepressants. Currently there are
dozens of antidepressants available, so you and your physician can’t know with certainty
if an antidepressant will work for you until you’ve taken one for a few weeks. Different
antidepressant medications may be prescribed, depending on the particular symptoms
you have and the specific effect you and your physician want to achieve. If the first antidepressant prescribed for you does not produce a beneficial effect, then your physician
will try others to see if the desired effect can be obtained. Unlike many other medications, antidepressants often take two to four weeks to reach their beneficial effect. And
because you may not respond positively to the initial medication prescribed for you, it
may take eight weeks or longer to achieve therapeutic levels of the right antidepressant.
One drawback to antidepressants is that many have annoying side effects, especially when a person first begins to take them. The side effects may include dry mouth,
drowsiness, and weight changes, although these often diminish or disappear after the
medication is taken for a period of time.
“Does Taking Medication Mean I’m Crazy?”
Almost everyone gets depressed sometimes. Being depressed does not mean you are
crazy. If you have been stuck in depression for a long time, or if your depression is quite
severe, it makes sense to try to find things that will help you feel better. If medication
is something that helps you, then it can be a worthwhile addition to your plan to feel
better. Taking medication doesn’t mean you are crazy. It means you are willing to try
different things to help yourself feel better. You can discuss with your physician any
concerns you have about medications, and can also ask how long you might need to take
them.
“How Long Will I Need to Take Antidepressant Medication?”
Once you and your physician find an effective antidepressant, you will probably take it
for one to two years, although some people benefit from taking antidepressant medication longer. You and your physician can evaluate together how long you should take
medication. In any case, when your physician recommends that you decrease antidepressant medication, she or he will want you to decrease them gradually and systematically.
It is important for you to follow your physician’s directions in taking and stopping antidepressant medications. Doses sometimes need to be increased and decreased slowly to
achieve the desired effects and to minimize side effects.
Improving Your Relationships
Some treatments for depression emphasize the importance of improving close relationships. Family and friends can provide positive support and help you recover from depres-
Understanding Your Depression 201
sion. You can use the strategies taught in this book to make your relationships better.
One of the people you follow in this book, Vic, used the skills he learned to improve
his relationship with his wife, Judy. Another self-help book that uses a cognitive therapy
approach for couples’ problems is Beck’s Love Is Never Enough (New York: HarperCollins, 1988). Gottman’s The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, now in its second
edition (New York: Harmony Books, 2014), is another worthwhile self-help guide for
improving your marriage or committed relationship.
If you are in an abusive relationship or a relationship with someone who criticizes
you constantly, it can be harder to recover from depression. Couple therapy or family
therapy can help you improve relationship conditions that may be feeding your depression. If you are being physically or sexually abused, almost all communities have special
programs nearby to help you. You can contact your local community mental health
center or a health professional for recommendations of programs near you.
Behavioral Activation
If you track your activities and feelings of depression, you may discover that when you
are depressed, you are less active. For this reason, an important part of recovering from
depression is to increase the number of activities that you do each day. Even more
important than just the number of activities are the types and quality of the activities
that we do. In general, we get the biggest mood boost from activities that bring us pleasure and a sense of accomplishment, that lead to approaching rather than avoiding life’s
challenges, and that are connected to what we value most. Each of us needs to discover
the right personal mix of these different types of activities to improve our mood. This
section of the book helps you discover the right mix for you.
You can use an Activity Record to track your activities and discover how they affect
your mood. When you keep this record for one week, it will help you identify what you
are doing when you feel most and least depressed. In addition to identifying your activities and moods, the Activity Record can be used as a guide to see what changes in your
behavior might help you feel better.
Look at Ben’s filled-in Activity Record in Figure 13.2. Notice that Ben wrote only
a word or two to describe his activity – just enough to remind him what he was doing
when he looked back at the record. When he did more than one activity in a time
period, he wrote down the one or two most important ones (e.g., “walk,” “breakfast”),
or a word that described the overall experience (“shopping”).
Although Ben thought the Activity Record would be hard to keep, he found that
he needed just a few seconds each hour to put down an activity and a depression rating.
Notice that on Thursday from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m., when his depression changed a lot
during the hour, he wrote both a low and a high rating to show the change.

The connection between activities and moods is important enough to suggest that
you pause in reading this chapter until you have had a chance to fi ll out an Activity
Record for a full week. Then continue reading this chapter. The remainder of the chapter will be more valuable to you once you have a better understanding of the connection
between your activities and moods. Worksheet 13.4 on pages 206–207 is the fi rst in a
series of worksheets that help you learn how activities can improve your mood.
how to Use the activity record
• Name the mood you will rate.
• Write down your activities for each hour of the day.
• For each hour, rate your mood from 0–100 with 0 showing you did
not experience that mood and 100 indicating the most you have ever
experienced that mood. Write your rating on the chart.
• After fi lling out an Activity Record for one week, look for connections
between what you do and your mood.
Pause here until you have had a chance to fi ll out an activity record for a full week.

Exercise: Using the Activity Record
First, choose a mood (depression or low mood, if that is why you are reading this chapter) that you
want to improve, and write this mood here:

During this week, you will be rating this mood on a 0–100 scale:

A little Medium A lot Most I’ve
ever felt
Fill in your Activity Record (Worksheet 13.4 on pp. 206–207) for one week. For each hour, write in
the activity you were doing, and rate your mood on the 0–100 scale. You may forget to do it for
some hours, but the more hours you fill in for the week, the more you will have a chance to learn
about the mood you are rating. Therefore, if you forget to do it one day, don’t give up – just continue the ratings when you remember.
To help you remember to fill out the Activity Record, carry a copy with you or make a digital
reminder to take notes on your activities and moods as you go through the day. It is not necessary
to fill it out every hour. Most people can remember their activities and moods for several hours, so
you may be able to fill it out several times a day rather than hourly. For example, at lunchtime, you
can write in all your morning activities and mood ratings. At dinnertime, you can do the afternoon
hours. At bedtime, you can fill in the evening hours.

Understanding Your Depression 209
1. Did my mood change during the week? If so, how? What patterns do I notice?
Yes, my mood changed. Once I get down, it seems to last for hours. Some days were not so
bad.
2. Did my activities affect my mood? If so, how?
Yes. On busy days I usually felt a little better. When I’m with people I care about, like my
wife, children, and grandchildren, I usually feel better. When I’m alone and just sitting
around, I tend to dwell on things and feel worse.
3. What was I doing when I felt better? Are these activities in my best long-term interest? What other activities
could I do that might also make me feel better?
Doing things with Sylvie – she is a happy person and she means so much to me. Fixing
the door – I felt useful. Serving breakfast at church is enjoyable because I talk to people
and get a chance to help out. Yes. Spend time with grandchildren. Play more golf.
Volunteer more time with church activities. Take Sylvie out to dinner.
4. What was I doing when I felt worse? Are these activities in my best interest? If so, is there a way I could do
them that would help me feel better while I was doing them?
Sitting in my chair thinking – worried about our money running out.
Phone call from Bob on Thursday – my granddaughter Nicole broke her arm.
Yes, in my best interest – it is necessary to deal with difficult situations or figure out
what to do. Maybe rather than just worrying, I could talk it over with Sylvie and decide
how to handle it.
5. Were there certain times of the day (e.g., mornings) or week (e.g., weekends) when I felt worse?
Felt worse in the mornings until I got going.
Felt worse early in the week.
6. Can I think of anything I could do to feel better during these times?
I guess it helps when I shower, get dressed. Walking seems to help, although I don’t feel
like it when I’m down. Getting out of the house helps on bad days. Being around or
helping other people tends to lift my mood.
7. Were there certain times of the day or week I felt better? Can I learn anything helpful from this?
Generally, later in the day I felt better. This week I felt better on Friday, Saturday, and
Sunday. This shows me that my worst moods don’t last forever. I tend to be around people
more on the weekends, which helps. Maybe I can figure out some ways to see more people
during the week.
8. Looking at my answers to these questions, what activities can I plan in the coming week to increase the
chances that I will feel better this week? Over the next few weeks?
Fix up things around the house. Plan more activities – especially things that involve
people I care about.
Visit my grandchildren. Walk Bob’s dog. Spend less time sitting alone. Volunteer more at
church.
FIGURE 13.3. What Ben learned from his Activity Record.
210 Mind Over Mood
As you can see, Ben learned a lot from his Activity Record. Depending on the mood
you tracked, you might have learned a variety of things from observing your own shifting moods. Depressed people often observe that as they become more active, it helps
them feel better. Write one or more ideas here about why you think activities might
improve your mood.
We don’t know for sure why depressed people often feel better when they are more
active. Here is a list of possible reasons:
• Some types of activities, like walking, increase brain chemicals connected to feeling better.
• When we are doing nothing, we are often thinking about negative things over
and over again. Activity helps distance us from negative thoughts.
• Activities can give us the opportunity to succeed (e.g., organize a room or desk),
to do something enjoyable (e.g., talk with someone we like), or to approach a
problem (e.g., begin working on something that has to get done). Each of these
experiences – success, enjoyment, approaching things we want to avoid – can help
us feel a little better. Doing things that are important to us, or connected to things
or people we value, helps create meaning in our lives. Generally, people feel better
when their lives have meaning or purpose.
As a first step toward treating depression, it is often helpful to increase activities
– especially pleasurable activities, those that lead to a sense of accomplishment, activities that help us approach rather than avoid things, and activities that reflect our values.
When we do these types of activities, we usually feel better.
To see if this works for you, fill out the Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory
(Worksheet 13.1) again, and write down your current score on Worksheet 13.2. It may
Understanding Your Depression 211
be higher, lower, or the same as when you filled out this inventory the first time. Then
use Worksheet 13.6, on pages 214–215, to schedule some of the types of activities you
have identified on Worksheet 13.5 as ones that are likely to improve your mood. Notice
that Worksheet 13.6 is just like an Activity Record, but it is called an Activity Schedule,
because you are going to write down planned activities ahead of time in the hope of
doing more things that help you feel better.
Plan to schedule a number of activities every day. Try different mixes of types of
activities. If you are a person who stays very busy mostly doing things that accomplish
something, then you may benefit the most from adding pleasurable activities. On the
other hand, if you are someone who already does a lot of pleasurable activities, you may
get the biggest mood boost from adding activities that accomplish something or overcome avoidance. Figure 13.4 shows the activities Ben wrote down during his Activity
Scheduling.
Pleasurable activities: Take a walk with Sylvie, visit the grandchildren, play golf,    
throw a ball with Bob’s dog, invite a friend to lunch, organize a card game, go to a    
movie, take Sylvie to dinner, go to my granddaughter’s recital, play music while I’m    
driving, pay attention to birds singing and flowers when I am outside, watch the    
children playing in the neighborhood, look at the stars at night, enjoy the smell of
food cooking.                                                          
Activities that accomplish something: Fix the dripping faucet, build a bird house,    
pay bills, organize my digital photos, clean the garage, do laundry, call to get the    
announcement of volunteer jobs that are not yet filled at church.                      
What I can do to begin to approach things I have been avoiding: Call to make a doctor’s    
appointment, get out of bed right away and take a shower (especially when I’m    
feeling down), talk to Sylvie about some of my worries, ask Sylvie to help me figure    
out activities to put on my schedule when I feel too depressed to do it myself.          
Activities that fit with my values: Take on more volunteer work at church, help

FIGURE 13.4. Ben’s list of activities for his Activity Schedule.
212 Mind Over Mood
Schedule Activities That Are Enjoyable or Accomplish Something
By scheduling and doing activities that are enjoyable or accomplish something, you will
be making behavioral changes that can reduce your depression.
• Doing ten enjoyable activities in a week are likely to help you more than doing
only five.
• Doing activities that are highly enjoyable are likely to help you more than doing
activities that are mildly enjoyable.
• Different people enjoy different activities. Choose activities that fit your interests
and values.
• Pleasurable activities need not be expensive or time-consuming.
• Examples of enjoyable activities include talking to a friend, listening to music,
playing a computer game, taking a walk, going out for lunch, watching a favorite
TV show or sporting event, or playing with your child. They are everyday, enjoyable events.
213
Exercise: Activity Scheduling
Before filling out Worksheet 13.6 on the next page, write down at least several activities you want to
plan for each day. You might find it helpful to review Worksheet 13.5, on page 208, especially your
answers to questions 3, 6, and 8. It is helpful to think of several activities in each of the following categories and spread them out throughout the week.
Pleasurable activities:
Activities that accomplish something:
What I can do to begin to approach things I have been avoiding:
Activities that fit with my values:
Some activities could fit in a variety of categories. For example, walking or exercising may be pleasurable for one person, may be an accomplishment for someone else, and may fit with a value of doing
healthy activities for yet another person. If you have been avoiding exercise for some time, it may even
be overcoming avoidance. Put activities in whatever category makes sense to you. The important thing
is to do activities in each of the four areas throughout the week.
214
Worksheet 13.6. Activity Schedule
Referring to the “Activity Scheduling” exercise (p. 213), use this worksheet to schedule some activities. Write down the times and days of the week you
plan to do these activities. If something more enjoyable or more important comes along, you can do that activity instead during that time period. If you
do something different during any time period, put a line through what you had planned and write down what you actually did. For each time period in
which you planned an activity, write down: (1) Activity. (2) Mood ratings (0–100).

worksheet (see the box at the end of the table of contents).
216 Mind Over Mood
Once you have done the activities on your Activity Scheduling Worksheet over the
course of one week, fill out the Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory (Worksheet 13.1)
again, and write down your score on Worksheet 13.2. By comparing your scores before
and after this week of activities, you will be able to see if activity scheduling makes a
difference in how you feel. Even small changes in your scores demonstrate that small
behavioral changes can lead to improvements in your mood. Depending upon your level
of depression, it may be necessary to do activity scheduling for a number of weeks before
you get a noticeable mood boost in your depression scores.
Questions about Activity Scheduling
The following questions and answers can help you if your mood doesn’t
improve when you add activities to your week.
“What if I don’t feel like doing the activities I scheduled?”
If you don’t feel like doing an activity, see if you can do it partially, even for
a few minutes. Often we don’t feel motivated to do things until we actually get started. You may be surprised to learn that motivation often follows
doing something rather than coming first, especially when we are depressed.
If you have skipped one or more activities on your schedule, try not to
get discouraged or to criticize yourself. Just pick up where you are and do
the next activity on your schedule. If you like, you can reschedule the activities you missed for another time during the week. The goal of the Activity
Schedule is to increase the number and types of activities you do, not to
perfectly complete every activity you plan. If you do activity scheduling for
several weeks, you may find it easier to do more activities as the weeks go by.
“What if I don’t enjoy the activities as much as I used to?”
If you decide to try activity scheduling as a first step in reducing your depression, do not expect to find activities as enjoyable or as satisfying as you did
before you became depressed. Ben, for example, enjoyed golfing a lot before
he became depressed, and yet he found that golfing was not as satisfying
when he was depressed. If Ben compared his golfing pleasure when he was
depressed to his earlier enjoyment of this activity, he might conclude, “This
is no good. I’m not having fun like I used to.” As a result of these thoughts,
Ben might actually have felt more depressed after golfing. However, if Ben
compared his golfing enjoyment to sitting at home doing nothing, he might
think, “It’s good that I went golfing. At least I enjoyed myself a little bit. It
was better than sitting at home feeling glum.”
“What if I don’t enjoy the activities at all?”
Notice what is going through your mind while you do activities. If you
are doing something that you thought would be enjoyable (like walking
Understanding Your Depression 217
through a park), and yet you are thinking about negative things at every
step, you are not likely to enjoy yourself. When you find yourself dwelling on negative things while you do activities, gently encourage yourself to
focus on the activity itself and look for something to feel good about (pleasure, accomplishment, overcoming avoidance, acting on your values). Don’t
get discouraged if you keep returning to negative thoughts, because this is
common in depression. You may need to pull yourself back to look for good
parts of the activity hundreds of times each day. Being aware that you are
drifting into negative thinking is a really good thing, because it gives you a
choice to try to do something different.
Some people, especially those who have been depressed for a long time,
have difficulty experiencing positive moods. If this is the case for you, try
capturing very tiny positive experiences. A helpful strategy for many people
who want to experience more enjoyment is to practice “capturing enjoyment.” This involves not only doing activities, but actively looking for pleasure while you do them.
It often helps to start with noticing your sensory experiences (sight,
smell, touch, hearing, and taste). Pay attention to all five of your senses as
you go through your day. Notice textures, sounds, smells, and sights that you
find even a little bit enjoyable. When you eat something, savor the flavors
that you taste. When you go outside, stop and smell the air, looking for any
smell that might be pleasant. Feel the air on your skin. Is the temperature
warm or cool? Listen for sounds that are interesting or pleasant, such as birds
or even the sounds of an engine running. Look at the colors that surround
you; notice people who seem pleasant or even humorous. It is helpful if you
can experience even a tiny moment of positive reaction to something. Such
tiny moments can be captured throughout the day.
Over time, it will become easier to experience positive moods more
regularly and for longer periods of time. Get into a mindset of savoring small
parts of your experiences. Once you can do this, you can add layers to your
enjoyment of activities by searching for positive aspects of your experiences.
For example, you might enjoy overhearing a bit of a funny conversation,
or having a friendly interchange with a clerk. When we deliberately make
a choice to look for positives in our day, we’ve cracked a window open to
allow positive experiences in. At the same time, when we are actively looking for positives, our minds are less focused on negatives.
It is best to do activity scheduling for several weeks until your scores on the Mind
Over Mood Depression Inventory (Worksheet 13.1, on p. 191) show some improvement.
Once you find it easier to do more activities throughout the day, then you are probably
ready to learn and practice the skills taught in Chapters 5–12, which can lead to additional improvements in your mood. When you are feeling better and your depression
scores are lower than when you began, go to Chapter 5 and you’ll find your next steps.
While you master these new Mind Over Mood skills, continue to do the types of activities
that help you feel better.

Understanding Your Anxiety
You may be reading Mind Over Mood to get help with anxiety. Even though it is very
common, anxiety is one of the most distressing moods that we experience. Some
people feel anxious most of the day and other people experience anxiety just in particular situations.
One of the women described and followed in this book, Linda, experienced panic
attacks and lots of anxiety when she needed to fly on an airplane. There were many days
when Linda did not experience any anxiety; yet, when she did get anxious, it sometimes
was so severe that she went to the hospital emergency room. She also considered turning down a job promotion because she didn’t want to get on an airplane or have more
panic attacks.
Linda was quite aware of the types of situations that made her anxious. For other
people, anxiety can seem a bit of a mystery, especially when it seems to come “out of
the blue.” As you learn more about anxiety and do the exercises in this book, you will
probably get better at identifying what triggers your own anxiety.
The word “anxiety” is sometimes used to describe the temporary nervousness or
fear we experience before and during challenging life experiences, such as a job interview or medical test. It is also used to describe more persistent types of anxiety, such as
phobias (fear of specific things or situations, such as heights, animals, insects, flying in
airplanes), social anxiety (fear of appearing foolish and/or being criticized or rejected in
social situations), panic disorder (intense feelings of anxiety in which people often feel
as if they are about to die or go crazy), posttraumatic stress disorder (repeated memories
of terrible traumas with high levels of distress), health worries (persistent worries about
having an illness or physical problem, despite being found healthy in medical tests), and
generalized anxiety disorder (characterized by frequent worries and physical symptoms
of anxiety).
220 Mind Over Mood
Think about your own anxiety for a minute:
When do you first remember feeling anxious?
Do you feel anxious most of the time, or just occasionally?
Is your anxiety mild, moderate, or severe?
Do you feel anxious throughout the day, or just in particular situations?
If you feel anxious in particular situations, write down the types of events or situations:
  I feel anxious when
  I feel anxious when
  I feel anxious when
  I feel anxious when
Now that you have identified some information about your anxiety, the next exercise helps you better understand the types of symptoms you experience when you are
anxious. Everyone has their own particular ways of feeling anxious. Identifying your
own patterns can help you target particular experiences that you want to change.
Exercise: Identifying and Measuring Symptoms of Anxiety
To specify what symptoms you experience when you are anxious, rate the symptoms listed in the
Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory (Worksheet 14.1). Fill out the inventory once a week while you
are learning methods to manage your anxiety, so you can determine which Mind Over Mood skills
are most effective and to track your progress.
Score the Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory by adding up the numbers you circled or
marked for all the items. For example, if you marked 3 for each item, your score would be 72 (3 ×
24 items). If you couldn’t decide between two numbers for an item and circled both, add only the
higher number.
To track your progress, record your Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory scores on Worksheet
14.2. Mark each column at the bottom with the date you completed the Mind Over Mood Anxiety
Inventory. Then put an × in the column across from your score.

Understanding Your Anxiety 223
The Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory and its score sheet (Worksheets 14.1 and
14.2) are tools you can fill out periodically (e.g., weekly or twice a month), to track
changes in your anxiety. Your first score on the inventory is called your baseline or starting score. You may notice changes in your scores (improvement or worsening) over time
and as you try different strategies to reduce your anxiety. For example, you might start
learning the strategies in this book, take steps to solve a problem that has been bothering
you, or enroll in cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). With each of these interventions,
you would hope and expect that the frequency and severity of your symptoms would
decrease, resulting in lower Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory scores. This is one way
to measure the helpfulness of different approaches you try.
Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory scores are not used to diagnose anxiety. If you
believe you are anxious, you can bring your completed Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory to a health care provider or mental health professional. Your answers on the inventory can help inform this person about your experiences, so she or he can determine a
diagnosis and discuss available treatments with you.
The symptoms you rate on the Mind Over Mood Anxiety Inventory include cognitive
(thought), behavioral, emotional, and physical changes, just as in the model described in
Chapter 2 (p. 7), which you have used to help understand your problems. Notice that
cognitive symptoms of anxiety include thoughts about danger or bad things happening,
thoughts that you won’t be able to cope, and various other worries. These thoughts often
occur as images, not just words. When anxious, we tend to avoid situations and places
where we might feel uncomfortable or anxious. Avoidance is the most common behavior associated with anxiety. There are many physical symptoms of anxiety, including
shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, dry mouth, sweating, muscle tension, shakiness,
dizziness, nausea or stomach problems, hot flashes or chills, frequent urination, restlessness, and even difficulty swallowing. A number of words are used to describe an anxious
mood, such as “nervous,” “panicky,” or “on edge.”
Figure 14.1 on the next page summarizes the types of symptoms that are common
in anxiety. The good news is that CBT and Mind Over Mood skills are highly effective in
reducing all these types of anxiety symptoms.
Life experiences can contribute to or trigger anxiety. Trauma (being physically,
emotionally, or sexually abused or bullied; being in an automobile accident; being in a
war); illnesses or deaths; things we are taught (“Snakes will bite you,” “If you get dirty,
you’ll get sick”); things we observe (an article in the newspaper about a plane crash,
“My heart just missed a beat”); and experiences that seem too much to handle (giving
a public speech, job promotion or termination, having a new baby) can all lead to feelings of anxiety. Linda’s anxiety began after her father’s death. At that time, Linda felt
overwhelmed and had greater difficulty coping with problems. She began to expect that
another catastrophe would occur and that she would not be able to cope with it.
All these physical, behavioral, and thinking changes we experience when we are
anxious are part of the anxiety responses called “fight, flight, or freeze.” These three
responses can be adaptive when we face danger. To see how this is so, imagine that you
are in a new town. You decide to go for a walk at night and find yourself lost on a dark
224 Mind Over Mood
street. You notice a large man approximately 20 yards away walking toward you. You
believe that he sees you and think that he is going to attack and rob you. What should
you do? One option would be to fi ght. To do this, your heart would pump faster, your
breathing would speed up, and your muscles would tense. Sweating would help cool
your body. As you can see, all these body changes would be helpful in this situation.
These changes make up the “fi ght” response.
But maybe you do not think fi ghting the man is a good idea. Perhaps you think it
would be better to run. To run fast, you would also need an accelerated heart rate, plenty
of oxygen, muscle tension, and sweating. Therefore, the same physical changes that
make up the “fi ght” response make up the “fl ight” response. You simply use the extra
energy to run rather than to stay and do battle. With a little luck, running may save you
from being attacked.
A third response that might work well would be to freeze. Maybe the man has not
seen you, and perhaps if you are very still, he will not notice you. In this case, a total
freeze would require you to have very tense, rigid muscles. With a tight chest, even your
breathing would be invisible to him. These types of physical changes that help you to be
very still are part of the “freeze” response.
These three anxiety responses – fi ght, fl ight, and freeze – are good reactions to danger. Anxiety is adaptive when dangers are real and serious. So we don’t really want to
get rid of anxiety completely. Think of anxiety as similar to our pain response: It would
be quite risky if we did not experience pain, because then we wouldn’t know to pull our
hands away from a hot stove. In the same way, we rely on our anxiety responses to alert
us to dangers that we might need to face or manage.
Unfortunately, we also experience anxiety when watching a movie about a robFIGUre 14.1. Profi le of anxiety symptoms.

bery or when standing in front of a group of people to give a speech. This book teaches
methods to reduce your anxiety when danger is not present, when the danger is not as
serious as you might think, or when too much anxiety interferes with your good coping. Anxiety treatment’s goals are to help you assess the degree of danger more quickly
and learn how to reduce your anxiety responses when dangers are smaller than you
imagine or can be managed through coping. Often this mean needing to approach
what you fear, in order to learn more about the degree of danger and your ability to
cope with it.
Anxiety Behaviors
There are two types of behaviors that characterize anxiety: avoidance and safety behaviors. We avoid and seek safety when we are anxious, because these behaviors help us feel
better in the short run. However, these common ways of coping with anxiety also tend
to prolong our anxiety, making it worse over time.
Avoidance
Peter needed to take a speech class as a school requirement. He felt really anxious when
he imagined speaking in front of his class. As a result, whenever he thought about
working on his speech, he procrastinated and did other things so he could avoid feeling
anxious. When he went out with his friends instead of working on the speech, he immediately felt better, because thoughts about the speech were replaced with a focus on his
friends. As the weeks went by, however, Peter became more and more afraid about the
upcoming speech. In addition, Peter did not speak up in class. Each time he had something to say, he felt a surge in his anxiety. When he decided not to speak, his anxiety
immediately decreased. Every time Peter avoided speaking, he was rewarded by feeling
better, which made it more likely that he would keep avoiding.
Although Peter’s avoidance helped him feel less anxious in the moment, it actually
made his anxiety worse over time. Avoidance usually leads to an increase in anxiety
for four reasons: (1) By not approaching and learning more about what frightens us, we
don’t have an opportunity to learn ways to tolerate our anxiety; (2) we don’t learn ways
to cope with the situation that frightens us; (3) we don’t have an opportunity to learn
that the situation may not be as dangerous as we fear; and (4) we don’t have an opportunity to find out if we are already capable of dealing well with the situation.
Mark, another student in Peter’s speech class, also felt anxious about giving a speech.
Rather than avoiding working on his speech, however, he took steps to reduce his anxiety. First, Mark asked other students about the teacher and speech class, to find out how
high the standards would be. He learned that the teacher was a tough grader, but was
encouraging as long as students made efforts to participate in class. Mark felt anxious
when he sat down to prepare his speech, but stuck with it and learned that his anxiety
decreased a bit when he began writing down possible topics and ideas. He began pre-
226 Mind Over Mood
paring his speech early and practiced dozens of times. He discovered that his anxiety
decreased with practice and preparation.
Mark also made comments in class discussions so that he could practice expressing
himself in the group. These experiences increased his confidence that he could speak up
and cope with everyone looking at him. One day a class member disagreed with one
of his ideas and made fun of him. He felt his face flush, but later realized that it was not
the end of the world, and he felt good about how he had handled this situation. Another
classmate told him that she thought his critic had been rude; this helped Mark realize
that even if he made some mistakes or people disagreed with what he was saying, some
people might still think positively about him.
One of the things we can learn from the examples of Peter and Mark is that avoidance brings immediate relief but increases anxiety over time. Facing our fears often leads
to distress at first, but helps us overcome anxiety in time. If you have been experiencing
anxiety, you may have been avoiding a number of situations and experiences. Make a list
below of some of the things you have been avoiding because of anxiety.

Safety Behaviors
In addition to avoidance, we often engage in safety behaviors when we feel anxious.
What are “safety behaviors”? These are things we do to reduce our sense of risk or
keep from being hurt in situations that make us anxious. While these purposes sound
like good things, safety behaviors actually often make our anxiety worse, because they
increase our perception that this situation is much more dangerous that it may actually
be. Here are some examples.
Tyra is afraid of snakes. When she takes her daughter to the zoo, she checks on the
Understanding Your Anxiety 227
map to see where the snake exhibit is housed. Even though she would prefer avoiding
this exhibit, her daughter wants to see the snakes, so she goes into the exhibit. While she
is there, Tyra keeps one arm on her daughter, just in case she needs to grab her and run
out of the exhibit quickly because a snake has gotten loose. Because she keeps her arm on
her daughter (safety behavior), Tyra actually thinks even more about danger than usual
and feels more anxious, even though the actual danger is close to zero.
Kenji is anxious about a lot of different things. At night, he is nervous that someone
will break into his home. He locks his door, and then a few minutes later gets anxious
and checks the door (safety behavior) to confirm that it is locked. He repeats this ritual
eight or nine times a night, every night. His anxiety goes down briefly each time he sees
the door is locked, but his worries quickly return, and he questions his memory that the
door is locked. Checking the doors is a safety behavior, and it keeps Kenji focused on
the danger of an intruder. His safety behaviors do not have lasting benefit in terms of
reducing his anxiety.
Roberta has to attend a weekly office meeting. Each week she becomes very anxious, because she is afraid the manager will ask her a question or assign her a job that she
can’t do. She attends all the meetings, but sits in the back row (safety behavior). She also
refrains from coughing, making eye contact, or volunteering information she does have
(more safety behaviors), because she doesn’t want to draw attention to herself. These
safety behaviors succeed in keeping Roberta out of the manager’s awareness, but they do
not reduce her anxiety over time. Instead, each week that her manager does not speak to
her, Roberta becomes more and more convinced that she could not handle it if he did.
Thus, over time, she becomes even more anxious in office meetings.
What Is the Difference between Safety Behaviors and Coping with Anxiety?
When we use safety behaviors, we often think we are doing a good job of coping with
our anxiety. But as the examples above show, safety behaviors generally keep us focused
on danger and support our belief that situations are highly dangerous, even when they
may not be. Like avoidance, safety behaviors help us feel better in the moment, but they
actually prolong our struggles with anxiety. This is because safety behaviors prevent us
from fully facing our fears and having the opportunity to build our confidence that we
can handle things that go wrong or seem dangerous to us.
Good coping, on the other hand, usually involves approaching our fears and managing our reactions and the situations that scare us. When we practice coping with our
fears, we build up confidence we can handle them, and our anxiety decreases. There are
two ways to tell the difference between safety behaviors and coping behaviors:
1. Safety behaviors are designed to eliminate danger; coping behaviors are designed
to help us approach, stay in, and manage situations that frighten us.
2. Safety behaviors maintain or increase anxiety; coping behaviors lead to a decrease
in anxiety over time.
228 Mind Over Mood
Tyra, Kenji, and Roberta are likely to experience a decrease in anxiety after a while if
they start to use coping instead of safety behaviors. For example, a good coping behavior
for Tyra might be to take her hand off her daughter and watch her daughter’s excitement
at seeing the snakes. In addition, Tyra can remind herself that all the snakes, even the
most dangerous ones, are safely enclosed and not able to escape.
In order to cope, Kenji could focus his attention on the action of locking the door.
Then, when he begins to feel anxious, he can stop himself from rechecking the door and
instead remind himself that he can tolerate the uncertainty and discomfort. This might
be difficult at first, but over time his urge to check will decrease, and he will realize that
the checking does not really increase his safety.
Roberta is fearful of being asked questions or assigned jobs that will put her in the
spotlight and lead to embarrassment or failure. Good coping might involve speaking out
in meetings when she does know information. She could also practice things she might
say if her manager asks her a question she does not know the answer to. If she is assigned
to a job she does not know how to do, she could ask for help from a coworker to build
her skills. The first few times Roberta tries these coping behaviors, she is likely to feel
more anxious. However, with experience, she will learn that often nothing bad happens,
and that even when it does, she can cope. Over time and with practice, her anxiety will
decrease and her confidence will increase.
Just like Tyra, Kenji, and Roberta, you may be using safety behaviors when you
get anxious. See if you can identify two or three safety behaviors you sometimes use to
try to prevent or reduce anxiety. Remember that sometimes safety behaviors are things
you do (e.g., only going to parties if a friend is with you, keeping an antianxiety pill in
your pocket in case you start to feel anxious) and sometimes things you don’t do (e.g.,
not making eye contact so people won’t talk to you, sitting in an aisle seat instead of the
middle of a row so you can make a quick exit if necessary). For this exercise, think of
particular situations in which you feel anxious, and recall what safety behaviors you use.
There may be more than one safety behavior for each situation.

Understanding Your Anxiety 229
Anxious Thoughts
The behaviors associated with anxiety (avoidance and safety behaviors) make even more
sense when you understand the thoughts that go along with anxiety. When we are anxious, we have thoughts about danger, threat, and our own vulnerability. A threat or danger
can be physical, mental, or social. A physical threat occurs when you believe you will be
physically hurt (e.g., a snake bite, a heart attack, being hit). A social threat occurs when
you believe you will be rejected, humiliated, embarrassed, or bullied. A mental threat
occurs when something makes you worry that you are going crazy or losing your mind.
In addition to having thoughts about danger, when we are anxious we believe we
can’t cope. In fact, anxiety occurs when our perception is that the danger we face is greater
than our ability to cope. Consider how you might feel if someone asked you to dive off
a large rock into a lake. There is a certain amount of danger involved, but if you are
confident that you know how to dive, the water is deep enough to be safe, and you have
watched others make the same dive and they seemed to enjoy it, then you might feel
excited instead of anxious. This is because you believe you can cope with the degree of
danger involved. Instead of focusing on danger, you can think about the excitement and
enjoyment of the moment. However, if you are not convinced that you can dive safely
and you are uncertain of your swimming ability, then you are likely to feel anxious
rather than excited in the same situation.
We make these judgments about danger and our ability to cope every day of our
lives. Our judgments about how fast or slow to drive, our decisions to stay on the curb or
walk across the street, our choices to speak up in a group or stay silent – all of these are
determined by our assessment of the dangers involved and our ability to cope with them.
When we think our ability to cope is equal to or greater than the dangers involved, we
do activities with ease. When we think we cannot cope with the risks or dangers in a
given situation, then we tend to pull back, avoid, and engage in safety behaviors.
Anxiety is not always a bad thing. If dangers are greater than our ability to cope, it
is wise to pull back. However, when we are frequently anxious, we tend to overestimate
danger and underestimate our ability to cope across many situations. This thinking style leads
us to experience anxiety in many more situations than necessary. Over time, anxiety can
become more severe and begin to affect more and more areas of our lives.
“What If . . . ?” Thinking
Anxious thoughts often predict future or imminent catastrophe. They often begin with
“What if . . . ?” and end with a disastrous outcome. Frequently, anxious thoughts include
images of danger as well. For example, a man with a fear of public speaking may think
before a talk, “What if I stumble over my words? What if I forget my notes? What if people think I’m stupid and don’t know what I’m talking about?” He may have an image of
himself standing frozen and blushing in front of the crowd. These thoughts are all about
the future and predict a negative outcome.
230 Mind Over Mood
Someone who is afraid of flying in airplanes or driving on the freeway may think,
“What if the airplane explodes? What if I have a panic attack on the airplane? What if
there’s not enough oxygen on the plane to breathe?” or “What if I have a traffic accident
on the freeway? What if I get stuck in rush-hour traffic, have difficulty breathing, and
can’t get to a freeway exit?” You can see that these thoughts are also future-oriented and
predict danger or catastrophe. They would make the person think twice about getting
on an airplane or freeway.
Some people feel anxious in close relationships. They may fear intimacy or commitment. They may also be concerned about being judged, rejected, or embarrassed.
The thoughts we have when we are fearful about relationships are, like the ones just
discussed, oriented toward the future and predict danger or catastrophe. These thoughts
include “What if I get hurt? What if I am rejected? What if the other person senses my
weakness and takes advantage of me?” Again, these thoughts demonstrate the “something terrible is going to happen” theme that is characteristic of anxiety.
The perception of threat varies from person to person. Some people feel a great
sense of safety and security. Other people feel threatened very easily and will often feel
anxious. Sometimes this is because of life experiences. For example, if you grew up in
chaotic and volatile surroundings, you might conclude that the world and other people
are always dangerous. In this case, your ability to anticipate danger and understand your
own vulnerability might have helped you survive as a child. If you grew up in a dangerous home, being able to recognize danger or its early warning signs may have been
critical to your emotional and perhaps your physical survival. You may have developed
a very fine ability to spot and respond to dangerous situations.
At this point in your life, however, it may be important to evaluate whether or not
you are overresponding to thoughts about danger and threat. Perhaps the people in your
adult life are not as threatening as those in your childhood. You might also consider
whether or not your resources and abilities as an adult can open up new and creative
ways of coping with threat and anxiety.
Imagery
Our anxious thoughts often occur as images. When we overestimate danger, we don’t
just think, “What if I have a car accident?”; we actually vividly imagine the scenes that
we fear. We might see a car accident in our minds, or hear the sirens of emergency
vehicles in our imaginations. When we underestimate our ability to cope, we often
see ourselves looking overwhelmed or even shaking uncontrollably. We might imagine
other people making fun of us, or hear the sounds of people laughing at us. Sometimes
the images in our mind draw on memories of past times when we were anxious or
experienced traumatic events. At other times, the images are fictional – creations of
our own minds. For example, we might imagine our boss as 10 feet tall and screaming
at us with an exaggerated red face. Because these types of images give rise to strong
feelings of anxiety, it is important to become more aware of them in order to learn
ways to respond to them. Throughout Mind Over Mood, whenever an exercise asks
Understanding Your Anxiety 231
you to identify your thoughts, this means thoughts that occur either as words or as
images.
Linda: Anxious thoughts during a panic attack
Linda experienced anxiety and panic attacks when she flew on airplanes. “Panic” is
extreme anxiety or fear. A “panic attack” consists of a distinct combination of thoughts,
emotions, and physical reactions. Often a panic attack is characterized by a change in
physical or mental sensations, such as rapid heartbeat, sweating, difficulty breathing,
a choking or smothering sensation, shaking, dizziness, pain in the chest, nausea, hot
flashes or chills, or disorientation.
Linda had to fly to a city 200 miles away for an impromptu business meeting. She
monitored her thoughts and emotional reactions before the flight and summarized them
on the partial Thought Record shown in Figure 14.2.
Notice how Linda’s anxiety and panic were influenced by thoughts that focused on
danger and personal vulnerability. It was not waiting in the airline terminal that caused
Linda to panic. Many people wait in airline terminals without feeling anxious or having
panic attacks. Linda’s thoughts about this situation led her to feel anxious and panicky.

Exercise: Identifying Thoughts Associated with Anxiety
To highlight the thoughts that are associated with anxiety or fear in your own life, complete Worksheet 14.3. Think about a recent time when you were anxious, fearful, or nervous. Describe the
situation, your mood(s), and any physical symptoms you experienced (e.g., rapid heart rate, dizziness, sweating, tight stomach). Recall the thoughts you had (in words and in images). If you had
an image, describe it. If your thoughts began with “What if . . . ?,” write down the answer to that
question (e.g., the thought or image that made you most anxious).

Understanding Your Anxiety 233
Were the thoughts you identified in the exercise future-oriented? Do the thoughts
reflect a sense of danger, inability to cope, or prediction of a catastrophe? If so, then you
have identified anxiety-related thoughts.
Anxiety is often triggered in vague and ambiguous situations. This makes sense
because if we tend to be alert to danger, it is hard to decide how dangerous a situation
really is if the details are uncertain. People who are anxious sometimes prefer to know
a negative thing for sure, rather than remain in a state of “not knowing.” This may be
one reason why we jump to the conclusion that something is dangerous, even when
we don’t know for sure. For example, if we have a physical symptom that puzzles us,
we sometimes immediately start thinking about serious illnesses rather than less serious
explanations.
In addition, anxiety often arises because we don’t have control over events. Often
when we are anxious, we try to be in control or do things perfectly, in the hope that this
will prevent bad things from happening. Since we don’t have confidence that we can
cope with the dangers that worry us, it makes sense that we try to prevent them. The
problem with this approach is that it is really impossible to do things perfectly or have
complete control over what will happen in the future. Thus learning to boost our confidence that we can cope when things go wrong is a more helpful approach to managing
anxiety than trying to prevent things from going wrong. Did you have any thoughts
related to control, perfectionism, or “not knowing” in the situation you described on
Worksheet 14.3?
Common Thoughts in Various Types of Anxiety Problems
Figure 14.3 summarizes common thoughts associated with the specific types of anxiety
problems mentioned earlier in this chapter. Notice that these thoughts pertain to the
danger that is central to each type of anxiety. For example, people with a snake phobia
have anxious thoughts and images related to snakes, and people with health worries have
thoughts and images about illness. For each category, it is also common to have doubts
about our ability to cope with the things we fear.
Overcoming Anxiety
When we have anxiety, we often just want to get rid of it as quickly as possible. We
might think it would be wonderful if we never felt anxious again. Actually, eliminating anxiety would not be a good idea. Anxiety is the body’s alarm system. It alerts us to
danger. If your home had an alarm system that was activated when a dog or cat entered
your yard, you would often be on the alert unnecessarily. This wouldn’t be a good reason
to disconnect your alarm. You would just need either to fine-tune it so it did not go off
so easily, or to learn to turn it off quickly as soon as you determined there was no serious
danger outside. That is what we try to do in overcoming anxiety. We want to do our
best to fine-tune our internal alarm system so it does not go off as often. Furthermore,
234 Mind Over Mood
we can learn to assess the level of threat in a situation and turn off the anxiety response
more quickly when we are overestimating danger. And we can increase our confidence
in our ability to cope with situations that make us anxious, as well as with anxiety itself.
Fine-Tuning the Anxiety Alarm System
CBT is more successful in treating anxiety than in treating any other type of mood
problem. There are specific and effective treatment approaches for every type of anxiety
described in Figure 14.3. The following sections briefly describe methods that are commonly used in all these treatments.
Overcoming Avoidance: Exposure
As described earlier in this chapter, avoidance is the most common behavior associated
with anxiety. When we avoid a difficult situation, we initially experience a decrease in
anxiety. This relief we feel is quite rewarding, and this makes us more likely to want
to continue avoiding in the future. Ironically, the more we avoid a situation, the more
anxious we become about facing it in the future. In this way, avoidance actually fuels
anxiety in the long run, because it helps convince us that the dangers we fear are serious
and we aren’t capable of coping with them.
To overcome anxiety, we need to learn to approach the situations or people we

Understanding Your Anxiety 235
avoid. Through these experiences, we have an opportunity to increase our confidence
in our ability to cope with the situations that frighten us. Learning to approach and cope
with situations in which we feel anxious is a lasting and powerful way of decreasing our
anxiety. Approaching our fears and coping with them is called “exposure.” Generally
speaking, the more exposure experiences you have, the less sensitive your anxiety alarm
becomes. That is, when you go into anxiety-provoking situations more often, your
anxiety alarm system learns not to see these situations as so dangerous. Making your
alarm less sensitive by repeated exposure for gradually increasing time periods is called
“desensitization.” In the next section, you learn to make a Fear Ladder to help you personalize your plans for exposure, so you can overcome your fears as quickly as possible.
Making a Hierarchy or Fear Ladder
When you experience high levels of anxiety, it is helpful to develop a hierarchy of the
situations, events, or people you fear. A “hierarchy” is a list, written in order of fear
intensity, with the most feared situation or event at the top and the least feared situation
at the bottom. You can think of it as a “Fear Ladder” on which the lowest step describes
a situation in which you experience a small amount of fear, and each step up the ladder
represents situations in which you experience greater degrees of fear. Start to approach
situations at the bottom of the ladder first, and work your way up the steps gradually,
rising up the ladder as you successfully master events until you can do them with only
a medium amount of anxiety. You will stay on each step and continue with exposure
practice until you become confident that you can handle that step and you learn to tolerate whatever level of anxiety you experience. By gradually approaching what you fear,
you will also gather evidence about the accuracy of your catastrophic expectations and
your ability to cope.
As an example, Juanita was nervous when she was asked to give a presentation at the
next city council meeting. She usually avoided speaking in front of groups because she
felt so anxious. To overcome her anxiety and avoidance, Juanita made a Fear Ladder that
looked like the one shown in Figure 14.4 on the next page.
Starting with situation 1 at the bottom of her Fear Ladder, Juanita successfully met
the challenges of each situation on her Fear Ladder by combining relaxation methods
(described later in this chapter), cognitive restructuring (Chapters 6–9), and Action
Plans (Chapter 10) to solve problems that might occur. Juanita did not proceed to the
next situation on her Fear Ladder until she could approach the current one with tolerable anxiety and increased confidence. She practiced step 4 – a step that could not be
easily repeated numerous times – in her imagination until she felt confident she could
do this in person. While Juanita experienced some anxiety when she actually gave her
presentation to the City Council, she was not nearly as anxious as she had been in similar
situations in the past. She credited her success to her step-by-step practice. Furthermore,
as Juanita walked to the podium, she reminded herself how well she had done the speech
in practice. By using different methods in combination, Juanita was able to give a public
speech, something she had previously avoided.
236 Mind Over Mood
Juanita used a Fear Ladder to help her approach public speaking. Sometimes there
is not just a single event coming up that makes us anxious, but a whole collection of
situations and experiences. For example, Paul avoided a variety of situations in which he
feared he might have a panic attack. He avoided driving alone, being too far from home,
getting onto elevators, sitting in the middle of a row of seats, and being in crowded
places. All these situations made Paul anxious, and he was afraid he would have a panic
attack if he approached and stayed in them. Paul thought about which of these situations
were the most difficult for him, and then made the Fear Ladder shown in Figure 14.5.
Notice that Paul planned many more steps on his Fear Ladder than Juanita needed
to plan. For each of Paul’s steps, he planned a variety of exposure experiments that were

gradually more challenging for him. For example, when in a movie theatre or at a sports
event, he first sat just a few seats from the aisle (step 1) and gradually moved to the center
as his confidence grew (step 2). For steps 3 through 7, he began each step at an easier
point. Once his exposure was successful (i.e., he was able to stay in the situation as long
as necessary to manage his anxiety), he increased the time or intensity of the experience.
So, for example, he rode an elevator many times, increasing the number of floors until he
could ride to the top of the building. Once he could do this in an uncrowded elevator, he
added the challenge of doing this at a busy time when the elevators were quite crowded.
It might seem that it would take Paul a very long time to take all these steps on his Fear
Ladder, but actually he was able to complete many exposure challenges successfully in a
single day – so he reached the top of the ladder in a few months, faster than he expected.

Exercise: Making My Fear Ladder
Make your Fear Ladder by filling out Worksheets 14.4 and 14.5. Worksheet 14.4 helps you brainstorm
and rate situations you avoid because of anxiety. Once this is done, put on Worksheet 14.5 the item
you rated with the highest anxiety on the top step, and the item you rated with the lowest anxiety
on the bottom step. Fill in the other steps from high to low based on your anxiety ratings. If you rated
some items equally, put them in the order that makes most sense to you, so that your Fear Ladder
steps move from your least feared at the bottom to your most feared situations at the top of the ladder. It’s OK if some of your steps are blank.
Worksheet 14.4. Making a Fear Ladder
1. First, brainstorm a list of situations, events, or people that you avoid because of your anxiety. Write them in
the left-hand column below, in any order.
2. After you complete your list, rate how anxious you feel when you imagine each of the things listed in the first
column. Rate these from 0 to 100, where 0 is no anxiety and 100 is the most anxious you have ever felt. Write
these ratings next to each item in the right-hand column.

240 Mind Over Mood
Using Your Fear Ladder to Overcome Anxiety and Avoidance
Once you make your Fear Ladder, you are ready to begin to approach your fears (exposure) and learn to manage your anxiety. You have control over how quickly or slowly
you proceed up the ladder. Your exposure to each step on the ladder is up to you; you
should not feel pushed or pressured to go faster than you believe you can. Having a sense
of control over the speed at which you work is likely to help you lower your anxiety and
overcome avoidance more quickly.
Moving up a Fear Ladder is never comfortable. But people who are willing to tolerate the temporary discomfort of moving up their Fear Ladders get over their anxiety
more quickly. Just as avoidance leads to short-term relief and long-term increase in
anxiety, exposure to the steps on your Fear Ladder leads to short-term discomfort and
long-term relief from anxiety. Therefore, you should spend as much time as possible
working on your Fear Ladder.
If you find that even the least feared situation on your Fear Ladder seems too difficult, you can either break down that step into smaller parts or begin with imagery
practice. Imagery practice is simply picturing yourself spending time on the step.
It is often helpful to imagine the situation in great detail. For example, Juanita
looked at photos of city council members she planned to visit and thought about the
expressions on their faces. She imagined how she would feel shaking their hands and
sitting in their offices. She even imagined her voice shaking a bit when she began to
speak. She found it helpful to imagine these meetings in two ways: sometimes when
everything went smoothly, and other times when she stumbled on her words and felt
quite embarrassed. By imagining both easy and difficult circumstances, she was able to
plan ways to handle the meetings no matter what happened. This increased her confidence.
Once you are comfortable with the situation in imagination, you can enter the situation in reality. As Juanita’s experience demonstrates, it is helpful to use as many of the
five senses as possible when doing exposure in your imagination. Imagine what you will
see, hear, smell, taste, and touch. It is also helpful to imagine what you might be thinking, feeling, and doing in the situation. Some people find it helpful to write down or
digitally record their imagined exposure. In this way, you can either listen to the recording or read what you’ve written to increase the number of exposures and move up the
Fear Ladder more quickly.
How do you know when to move from one step on the Fear Ladder to the next?
You don’t need your anxiety to go away completely (a rating of 0). In fact, most people
will continue to have some anxiety until they have faced the situations they fear many
times. The goal is to get your anxiety to a tolerable level. For most people, a good guideline is to stay on each step until the anxiety decreases by more than half or drops below
a rating of 40 on the 0–100 scale.
If you have trouble staying in the situation, you can use some of the coping skills
described later in this chapter that will help you stay on each ladder step for longer peri-
Understanding Your Anxiety 241
ods of time. Sometimes a supportive spouse/partner or friend can help you become more
willing and motivated to face the steps on your Fear Ladder. If you want a helper, choose
someone you trust who understands the nature of your fears and avoidance. This person
can serve as an empathic source of motivation and support as you do initially difficult
activities. Ideally, you will later face your fears on your own as easily as you do with a
helper present.
You should expect that your anxiety will increase when you first begin to approach
on your Fear Ladder. This is a good sign that you are facing your fears. Alternatively, if
there is no anxiety, then either you are not taking big enough steps to face your fears,
or you are relying too much on safety behaviors. In addition, for each step of your Fear
Ladder, you are learning to tolerate anxiety as you stay in the situation longer. The
more you do this, the easier it will become for you to experience anxiety and move up
the steps of your Fear Ladder. Ironically, as we become more comfortable with anxiety,
our anxiety often decreases. In order to successfully approach and stay in feared situations, use the skills described below to manage your anxiety while you work on your
Fear Ladder.
Managing Your Anxiety
It is normal to want to leave or avoid situations when you feel anxious. As you have
already learned, it is important to overcome this tendency and stay in situations so you
learn to tolerate your anxiety and discover that you are capable of handling the challenges of your fear. In this and other chapters of this book you will learn ways to manage
and reduce your anxiety as well as to tolerate increasing amounts of anxiety.
There are a number of things you can do. Once you learn two or three skills to
manage and tolerate your anxiety, you will move up your Fear Ladder more quickly. It is
important to use these skills to stay in the situations on your Fear Ladder. You don’t want
to use these skills as safety behaviors to protect you from dangers you fear, or as ways
to try to eliminate anxiety. Instead, the goal is to use anxiety management strategies to
reduce anxiety to a level you can tolerate and still stay in the situation.
Mindfulness and Acceptance
“Mindfulness” is a practice of learning to stay in the present moment and observe with
full attention your experience and immediate surroundings. Part of mindfulness is also
accepting your experiences without making judgments about them. For example, you
may often walk down a street with your mind focused on what happened earlier in the
day or what will happen later, or you may even be scanning texts or emails on a mobile
device. Mindful walking means focusing your attention on the motion of your feet, the
feel of your muscles as you move, the wind blowing against your skin, the colors and
sounds that surround you, and other sensory experiences such as smells or even your own
breathing. When there are unpleasant parts of your experience, it can be worthwhile to
242 Mind Over Mood
practice acceptance, which means noticing the unpleasantness without trying to change
it into something different or positive.
This is not as easy as it sounds. When you first try to practice mindfulness for even
a minute or two, it is quite common for your mind to drift into the future or the past.
This is to be expected. Awareness of your mind drifting is a good thing, because this
gives you the opportunity to remember to return to your current moment and experience. Part of being mindful is to notice your mental drift without judging it. Instead,
gently bring yourself back to the present moment. Mindfulness can be practiced during
various activities throughout the day, such as while you eat, walk, or talk with someone.
Once you are able to be mindful for even a few minutes in situations that don’t make you
anxious, you are ready to use this skill in situations that make you anxious.
Linda learned to practice mindfulness effectively in the early phases of her therapy.
Linda was on an airplane when the pilot announced that the plane would be delayed on
the runway for 20 minutes. Her initial thoughts were “I won’t be able to handle this. I’ll
have a panic attack,” and she became anxious. Linda then decided to experiment with
mindfulness.
Linda focused her attention on various parts of her current experience. She noticed
shades of blue in the sky and the colors and shapes of the clouds. She allowed her eyes
to run over the outlines of the clouds and observed closely the texture of each cloud.
Linda tuned in to her breathing and noticed that it began to slow a bit as her anxiety
decreased. She felt the texture of her clothes and listened to the sounds of passengers
nearby. Linda became so absorbed in these scenes that the 20-minute delay went by
quickly with tolerable levels of anxiety. It also helped that she accepted the anxiety she
felt. She thought, “This is an unexpected delay. I’m still anxious about flying, and I
understand and accept that I am feeling anxious. I don’t need to change it. I can tolerate it.”
Mindfulness and acceptance help with anxiety in several ways. First, most anxiety
is about fears that are not currently happening, but about things we fear might happen
in the future, even a few minutes from now. If you learn to keep your mind in the present moment, your anxiety will decrease. Second, when you are fully engaged in the
moment, your brain is not focused on your fears. Focusing on the present moment occupies your mind and helps you feel grounded in your experience. This generally leads to a
feeling of relaxation. Third, one of the long-term benefits of mindfulness and acceptance
is that they can help you tolerate and feel less anxiety, because you will learn to see your
anxious thoughts as simply mental activity rather than as the truth. With practice, you
can begin to understand your personal patterns of thinking and responding to events.
You can learn that you don’t need to respond to your patterns of thinking and emotional
reactions. Instead, you can simply observe them as they occur. People who practice
mindfulness on a regular basis generally report greater feelings of calm, well-being, and
acceptance of life’s difficulties.
If mindfulness sounds like something that would be helpful for you, many communities have classes that teach mindfulness. There are also books, audio programs, and
mobile apps that teach and can remind you to engage in mindfulness practice.
Understanding Your Anxiety 243
Breathing
A related way to manage your anxiety is to practice balanced, deep breathing. Many
people breathe shallowly or irregularly when they are anxious or tense. These breathing patterns lead to an imbalance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body, which can
cause the physical symptoms of anxiety. For example, when we breathe more shallowly,
we take in less oxygen. One of the functions of the heart is to pump oxygen throughout
the body via the blood stream. If the heart gets less oxygen, it beats faster to try to supply
the same amount of oxygen to the body.
In the beginning, it is important to practice balanced, deep breathing for at least
four minutes at a time, because this is roughly how long it takes to restore the balance of
oxygen and carbon dioxide in your body. The balancing works most effectively if you
breathe slowly and deeply in and out for an equal amount of time. If you put one hand
on your upper chest and one hand on your stomach, your hand on your stomach should
move out as you breathe in.
Try breathing in to a slow count of 4 and out to a slow count of 4 for four minutes
right now, and see if you become more relaxed. It doesn’t matter whether you breathe
through your mouth or your nose; breathe whichever way is comfortable for you. Be
sure to breathe gently and not take big gulps of air. Try to keep your attention on your
breath and the motion of your hand on your stomach as it moves up and down. When
you find your attention drifting elsewhere, just bring it back to your breathing. Again,
it helps to practice this skill when you are not highly anxious. If you practice balanced
deep breathing four minutes at a time, four times a day for a week, you will get quite
skilled at it. Then you are ready to use it to manage your anxiety and help you stay for
longer periods of time in situations in which you feel anxious.
Progressive Muscle Relaxation
“Progressive muscle relaxation” is a technique in which the major muscle groups in the
body are alternately tensed and relaxed. The process can proceed from the head to the
feet or from the feet to the head. Progressive muscle relaxation can lead to deep levels
of physical and mental relaxation. The idea is to tense and then relax the muscles in the
forehead, eyes, mouth and jaw, neck, shoulders, upper back, chest, biceps, forearms,
hands, stomach, buttocks, groin, legs, thighs, calves, and feet. Each muscle group is
tensed for 5 seconds and then relaxed for 10–15 seconds, then tensed again for 5 seconds
and relaxed again for 10–15 seconds. Generally you want to choose a time to do this
exercise when it is relatively quiet, and in a place where you are comfortable and unlikely
to be disturbed. It will take about 15 minutes to go through all the muscle groups.
When you use progressive muscle relaxation, it is really important to notice the difference between feelings of relaxation and feelings of tension. For some people, relaxation feels heavier or warmer than feeling tense. Others experience a lighter feeling.
Whatever your experience is, notice the difference so you will become better aware of
tension and relaxation in your body.
244 Mind Over Mood
Once you become more aware of your muscle tension, you can use these relaxation
exercises throughout your day and particularly when you begin to feel anxious. Different people carry muscle tension in different parts of their bodies, so the particular areas
that need emphasis vary from person to person. Most people report increased levels of
relaxation and decreased levels of physical tension and anxiety when they do progressive
muscle relaxation. Repeated practice of any relaxation method creates even deeper levels
of relaxation. Relaxation is a skill that can be developed, much like playing the piano or
throwing a ball: The more you practice, the greater your development of the skill will
be. When you become more skilled, this is a method that you can use as an alternative
to avoidance, to help you manage your anxiety and stay on the steps of your Fear Ladder
long enough for your anxiety level to go down.
Imagery
Imagery can be used to help you calm down before you enter a situation that is likely to
make you feel anxious. Imagery can also give you the courage to stay in situations long
enough to experience the natural reduction in anxiety that occurs over time. It helps to
imagine scenes that are tranquil and relaxing to you, or inspirational ideas that increase
your commitment to facing anxiety. Relaxing scenes may be actual places you know
that feel safe and calming, or they may be tranquil scenes you create in your mind. Inspirational imagery can include people, music, or situations that increase your courage and
confidence. The specific scene is less important than how the image makes you feel and
whether it helps you face your anxiety.
The more senses you can incorporate into your image, the more helpful your imagery is likely to be. If you can imagine the smells, sounds, sights, and tactile sensations
of the scene, you will improve your ability to relax or get inspired. For example, if you
imagine yourself walking along a tree-lined mountain path, you may want to focus your
attention on the birds singing, the light dancing through the tree branches, the smell of
pine, the greenness of the forest, and the cool breeze as it touches your skin. If you have
an inspirational scene from a movie, and you want to use this image to help you tolerate
a higher level of anxiety, you might imagine how this person looks, the music playing
in the background, and the feeling of courage in your chest. Each of your senses can
contribute to your experience of relaxation and/or confidence.
Understanding Your Anxiety 245
Imagery does not need to be about a place or another person. You may find it helpful to vividly recall experiences in which you felt confident and capable. Jolene was
nervous about an upcoming meeting with her manager. In the past she had found ways
to avoid such meetings, but this was now a step on her Fear Ladder, and she was committed to taking that step. Before the meeting, she decided to use imagery to help calm
herself, boost her confidence, and put herself in a better frame of mind. One area of her
life where Jolene felt confident was her part-time job as a piano teacher. She decided to
imagine vividly how she felt when she worked with her piano students. She remembered
and imagined her sense of pride and accomplishment when her students played music
well. She heard the music in her mind and felt the cooling air of the window fan in
her piano room. She felt her back straighten, and she took on the posture of a successful teacher. After spending five minutes imagining this scene, Jolene felt calmer, more
confident, and more capable. When she entered the meeting with her manager, she was
able to sit tall in her chair, and she felt more prepared to stay in the situation and tolerate
whatever anxiety arose.

Understanding Your Anxiety 247
Changing Anxious Thoughts
Changing your anxious thoughts is one of the most important things you can do to
bring about an enduring reduction in anxiety. Anxiety can be reduced either by decreasing your perception of danger or by increasing your confidence in your ability to cope
with the things you fear. Many of the Mind Over Mood skills taught throughout this book
will help you learn to test and change your anxious thoughts. At the end of this chapter,
Figure 14.6 recommends an order in which to read Mind Over Mood chapters that will
help you learn skills to manage your anxiety.
One main skill that will help with your anxiety is to use behavioral experiments
(see Chapter 11) to test your thoughts related to steps on your Fear Ladder. As you have
begun to do in this chapter, the fastest way to reduce anxiety is to face it by using a
Fear Ladder. You can do experiments on each step of your Fear Ladder to see how you
can cope with situations that you have previously avoided. These experiments offer the
possibility of learning that you are more capable of coping than you originally believed.
Chapter 10 helps you develop Action Plans and use acceptance to help you face situations
on your Fear Ladder.
Chapter 11 teaches you about underlying assumptions, which are a common type of
belief present in anxiety. For example, a common assumption for anxious people is “If
something goes wrong, then I won’t be able to cope.” In Chapter 11, you learn how to
set up behavioral experiments to test these types of anxious assumptions.
If working on your Fear Ladder is proving helpful for you, you can read and use the
ideas taught in Chapters 10 and 11 as soon as you finish this chapter. If you decide to read
those chapters first, you can read Chapters 5–9 of the book after you finish Chapters 10
and 11.
Chapters 5–9 teach you how to set personal goals, notice improvement, and test
your anxious thoughts so that you can more quickly evaluate how dangerous a situation
actually is and how well you can cope with it. Your anxiety may decrease if you examine
the evidence and discover that the danger you face is not as bad as you thought and your
ability to cope is better than you thought.
When Your Anxious Thought Is an Image
As described earlier in this chapter, anxious thoughts often occur in the form of images
as well as words. These images can be still pictures, such as your face blushing. Very
often, images appear more like a film in which an entire scene plays out. For example,
you might imagine a sequence in which you say something embarrassing and then turn
a deep shade of red, while people laugh at you and shake their heads as they walk away.
Whether in words or images, anxious thoughts are usually either about danger (“Something will go wrong,” “I’ll die of embarrassment,” “My boss will think less of me and
I’ll be fired”) or the inability to cope (“I can’t handle this,” “I’m weak,” “Other people
are more confident than me”).
Often images are distorted. For example, if you have an image of your boss being
248 Mind Over Mood
upset with you, your image might picture your boss as taller and more frightening than
in real life. Or your image might exaggerate how uncomfortable you look to someone
else. Such distortions are common in anxious imagery. Thought Records (Chapters
6–9) can be used to test your images and see how closely they fit your actual experience. You can also use experiments to test distorted beliefs. For example, if you imagine
your face is deep red, you can take a selfie photo and compare the photo with your
imagination.
When your anxious images are accurate descriptions of the dangers you face, it is
helpful to figure out what strategies will best help you cope with them (Chapter 10).
As you can see, changing anxious thoughts involves both testing your predictions of
danger and improving your awareness of and confidence in your coping ability. The
approaches you learn in this book will work equally well, whether your thoughts are in
words or images.
Medication
Even though medications may offer relief from anxiety, they can interfere with lasting
improvement. Research suggests that this is probably because medications often reduce
opportunities to learn, practice, and develop new skills, such as those taught in this book.
In addition, when people approach their fears while they are on medications, they tend
to think that the drugs are the reason for their success. For example, imagine you succeed in staying for a long time on one of the steps of your Fear Ladder. If you do this
while you are on a medication, you might think your success is due to the drug and not
to your skills and coping practice.
An important part of overcoming anxiety is learning to tolerate feeling anxious.
If medications reduce your feelings of anxiety, then you don’t have the chance to learn
that you are able to tolerate and manage these feelings. To develop skills to manage
anxiety, you need to feel anxious and learn how to reduce and/or tolerate it. You cannot
fully appreciate the effects of mindfulness and acceptance, breathing, progressive muscle
relaxation, imagery, changing anxious thoughts, and overcoming avoidance if you are
taking medication. One benefit of an initial high level of anxiety is that this increases our
motivation to learn and practice coping skills. When we are very anxious, our desire to
learn new methods to manage anxiety is very high.
The effectiveness of any intervention, including medication, is measured by relapse
rates as well as by immediate effect. Relapse rates record the number of people helped
by an intervention who reexperience the same symptoms when the treatment ends.
Understanding Your Anxiety 249
People who have been successfully treated for their anxiety disorders with only medication experience high rates of relapse. That is, the majority of people who benefit from
medication as their only treatment for anxiety have a return of anxiety within a year
after they stop taking the medication. In contrast, studies show that most people treated
successfully with CBT for anxiety are still anxiety-free up to one year after the end of
treatment. CBT teaches skills for managing anxiety that lead to long-lasting improvement. In other words, once you get better with CBT, you are likely to stay better. The
same cannot be said of medication.
One additional caution regarding antianxiety medications is to be aware of their
addiction potential. Many of the medications recommended to treat anxiety are tranquilizers. Tranquilizers have addiction potential. People who take tranquilizers for an
extended period of time may develop tolerance, which means that it takes greater and
greater amounts of the tranquilizer to produce a relaxed effect. In addition, after taking tranquilizers for an extended period of time, many people experience withdrawal
symptoms if they suddenly stop taking the medication. Withdrawal symptoms include
nausea, sweating, jitteriness, and an intense craving for the medication. Withdrawal and
tolerance are two of the primary characteristics of addiction. This is why your physician
will monitor you closely if you are on any of these medications. This is also why your
physician may recommend this book to help you learn other methods to cope with your
anxiety.
This does not mean that medication should never be used in the treatment of anxiety. However, most research suggests that when antianxiety medication is used, it should
be used on a short-term basis only – for weeks instead of years. Also, research indicates
that medication will rarely be enough to create enduring improvement. Learning anxiety management skills in CBT should be part of a treatment plan to maximize the likelihood of long-lasting results.
Making the Best Use of Mind Over Mood for Anxiety
If you have already read Chapters 1–4 (step A in Figure 14.6 on the next page) and
completed all the exercises in this chapter (step B in Figure 14.6), you are now ready to
develop other Mind Over Mood skills. While all of the skills taught in Mind Over Mood
can help you with anxiety, it may be best to develop these skills in a particular sequence.

Chapter 14 Summary
X Common types of anxiety include phobias, social anxiety, panic disorder,
posttraumatic stress disorder, health worries, and generalized anxiety disorder.
X Anxiety symptoms include a wide range of physical reactions; moods that range
from nervousness to panic; avoidance of situations or feelings; and worries
about danger, as well as thoughts about not being able to cope.
X Common behaviors when we are anxious are avoidance and safety behaviors.
These types of behaviors reduce our anxiety in the short term, but make our
anxiety worse over time.
X Anxious thoughts include overestimations of danger, along with
underestimations of our ability to cope with the threats we anticipate.
X Thoughts that accompany anxiety often begin with “What if . . . ?” and contain
the theme that “Something terrible is going to happen, and I won’t be able to
cope.”
X Our anxious thoughts often occur as images. It is important to identify these
images so we can respond to them in helpful ways.
X Different types of anxiety are characterized by different thoughts, depending
on the type of dangers anticipated.
X One of the best ways to overcome anxiety is to face our fears through exposure
to what scares us. A Fear Ladder is often used to help us face our fears one step
at a time at a pace we can tolerate.
X Many skills can help us manage anxiety as we face our fears, including
mindfulness and acceptance, breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, imagery,
and changing our anxious thoughts.
X Medication may be helpful to some people in the short term, but it does not
lead to enduring improvement in anxiety for most people.
X Changing our thoughts is an important way to achieve enduring improvement
from anxiety.
X Mind Over Mood chapters can be customized and read in various orders, to help
you learn Mind Over Mood skills for various purposes. Figure 14.6 describes a
helpful chapter reading order for anxiety.

Understanding Your Anger,
Guilt, and Shame
You may be reading this chapter because you or someone you care about struggles
with anger, guilt, or shame. These moods affect almost all of us sometimes. They
are a problem when they affect us more days than not, and when they lead us to make
decisions or choices in our lives that hurt either us or other people.
Two of the people described in detail throughout this book struggled with these
moods. Vic was a salesperson who generally got along well with colleagues and friends.
However, he sometimes had explosive anger, especially when he felt disrespected or
when people close to him didn’t seem to care about him. His difficulties in controlling
his anger at home created significant problems in his marriage with Judy. Marissa was a
working mother of two teenage children. Despite overcoming many difficulties in her
life, Marissa frequently experienced deep shame about having been sexually abused as a
young girl. Her shame affected her self-esteem and her relationships.
As Vic’s experiences illustrate, anger is a feeling that often leads us to attack and hurt
others. When we experience guilt or shame, we may attack and hurt ourselves as Marissa
did. This chapter describes anger, guilt, and shame, and details strategies for understanding and dealing with these moods.
If you are using this book to target anger, guilt, or shame, use the scales in Worksheet 15.1 to rate these moods on a regular basis. Positive change will show up as experiencing these moods less often, for shorter durations of time or less strongly. For example,
if you are dealing with anger, as you progress through the book you may find that you
get angry less often, stay angry for shorter periods of time, and feel it more mildly.
Changes in any of these areas can be signs of progress and are important to track and
measure over time.

Exercise: Measuring and Tracking My Moods
Worksheet 15.1 can be used to track a variety of moods including anger, guilt, shame, and positive
moods such as happiness.
Worksheet 15.1. Measuring and Tracking My Moods

 Understanding Your Anger, Guilt, and Shame 255
Once you have rated the frequency, strength, and duration of your mood, and
marked your scores with today’s date on Worksheet 15.2, you are ready to learn more
about anger, guilt, and shame and what you can do to feel better for those moods.
ANGER
Rick asked his partner, John, to put his new shirt in the laundry while Rick went grocery
shopping. John was happy to do this and put the shirt in the dryer after it was washed.
When Rick got home, he asked about the shirt, and John realized he had forgotten to
take it out of the dryer. When he removed the shirt from the dryer, it appeared to have
shrunk. Rick was furious because he thought John should have been more careful and
read the instructions to fi nd out if the shirt could be machine dried. Rick yelled at John,
“You don’t care about my stuff! You are so careless and thoughtless!” John was hurt.
Although he felt bad about Rick’s shirt, he thought that Rick’s anger was out of proportion. John yelled back, “It’s your fault! If your shirt needed special care, you should have
told me! I won’t do you any more favors!”
You may or may not express anger as Rick and John did, but you probably have
experienced similar feelings of anger when you thought that you were being seriously
mistreated, or that someone was hurting you or taking advantage of you. As all moods
are, anger is accompanied by changes in thinking, behavior, and physical reactions, as
shown in Figure 15.1. When we are angry, our bodies mobilize for defense or attack.
Our thoughts are often fi lled with plans for retaliation or “getting even,” or we focus on
how “unfairly” we have been treated.
Notice that the emotion of anger can range from irritation to rage. How angry we
become in a given situation is infl uenced by our interpretation of the meaning of the
event. After their argument about the shirt, John became silent the rest of the day. If

Rick interpreted this reaction as John’s having hurt feelings, Rick might be mildly irritated or even concerned for John’s feelings. However, if Rick thought that John’s silence
meant John didn’t care about him or was ignoring his concerns, Rick would probably
feel much angrier.
There is great individual variation in the types of events that elicit anger. One person may get angry while standing in line, and yet may listen calmly to criticisms of job
performance. A different person may be perfectly content to stand in line, and yet may
quickly attack anyone who points out work flaws. The types of events that provoke our
anger are usually linked to our past, as well as to rules and beliefs that we hold.
For example, if we have been abused frequently or severely in the past, we may have
a tendency to be “on guard” against future abuse. Some people who have a long history of abuse or criticism are quick to see current events as abusive and may experience
chronic anger, sometimes seemingly out of proportion to the events that provoke their
anger.
The pattern of quick and frequent anger goes along with a belief that it is possible
to protect ourselves by confronting abuse. What about people who have been frequently
abused, but who feel helpless to protect themselves? People who believe they are helpless often react to abuse not with anger, but with resignation or depression. If you feel
helpless in the face of abuse, your challenge may be learning to experience anger when
someone is hurting you, rather than learning to control it. Therefore, anger can be a
problem either because it is too frequent, out of proportion to the event, and expressed in
destructive ways, or because it is absent. It is normal to feel angry sometimes, and anger
can be a healthy and adaptive response.
Exercise: Understanding Anger
To understand what happens when you are angry, remember a recent time when you felt angry
or irritated. Describe the situation in column 1 of the partial Thought Record in Worksheet 15.3.
Write one word to describe your mood in this situation (e.g., anger or irritation). On a 0–100 scale,
with 100 being enraged or the angriest you have ever felt, 50 being a medium level of anger, and
10 being mildly irritated, rate your mood.
At the point when you were most angry, what was going through your mind? Write these
thoughts (words, images, memories) in column 3. If you are uncertain what thoughts, images, or
memories you had in this situation, Chapter 7 teaches you how to identify these.
If anger is a mood you want to understand better, repeat this exercise for two other recent
situations in which you have been angry: Describe the situations; rate the intensity of your mood;
and then write down your thoughts, including any images or memories you had. Once you have
filled out Worksheet 15.3 for several situations, proceed to the next two sections of this chapter,
which will give you a better understanding of anger and outline approaches to help you manage
and/or express your anger in constructive rather than destructive ways.

Angry Thoughts
Anger is linked to a perception of threat, damage, or hurt, and to a belief that important
rules have been violated. We also can become angry if we think we have been treated
unfairly or prevented from obtaining something we expected to achieve. In the fight
over the damaged shirt, Rick was angry because he expected that John would clean his
shirt without any damage. John was angry because Rick’s personal attack (“You are
so careless and thoughtless!”) seemed very unfair. It discounted his love and caring for
Rick and his good intentions in laundering the shirt. Notice the emphasis on fairness,
reasonableness, and expectation. It is not simply the hurt or damage that makes us angry,
but the violation of our rules and expectations.
Imagine a man who loses his job. Does he feel angry? It depends. If the man loses his
job and considers this a fair decision (perhaps because the company went bankrupt and
258 Mind Over Mood
all of its employees lost their jobs), he is unlikely to feel angry. However, if he thinks his
job loss was unfair (perhaps others were not fired, or only men of a certain race or age
lost their jobs), then he may feel very angry.
Similarly, if a child steps on your foot while you are riding on a bus, you feel pain.
Whether or not you feel angry depends on your interpretation of the intent and reasonableness of the child’s behavior. Your anger is likely to be quick if you think the injury
was intentional. But if you think that the child stepped on your foot by accident when
a swerve of the bus made the child lose balance, you may wince in pain, but you probably do not feel anger. The probability of anger in response to an injury is related to your
judgments of reasonableness or intention. For example, on an overcrowded bus, you may
overlook someone’s stepping on your foot more easily than you do on a nearly empty bus.
These rules of anger may seem quite straightforward until you consider that people
vary greatly in what they consider fair and reasonable. Rick expected John to be attentive and supportive to him, even when Rick was behaving in ways John considered hurtful. John expected Rick to speak calmly to him, even when Rick was feeling enraged.
Both Rick and John believed that their own expectations were reasonable and the other’s
expectations were unrealistic.
As Rick and John discovered, anger is most likely to emerge in close relationships.
Anger is rarely so intense as when it is experienced with someone with whom we are
in close contact, whether this person is a love partner or a work colleague. The link
between anger and intimacy can be best understood by recognizing that each of us has
multiple expectations for our friendships, love relationships, work partnerships, and so
forth. We are less likely to have specific personal expectations for people we meet casually. We rarely feel intense anger toward a store clerk, because our expectations for this
type of relationship are quite low. The closer our relationship with someone, the more
likely it is that we have high expectations of this person. To complicate the picture, we
may not tell people about our expectations, or even become aware of them ourselves,
until they have been broken. Then we feel hurt, disappointed, and often angry.
Anger Management Strategies
Testing Angry Thoughts
How we respond to angry thoughts depends on the role these thoughts play in our
lives. If we rarely experience anger, and angry thoughts arise from a clear injustice, our
response will be to find out how to use our anger to respond constructively to the situation. When we are frequently angry, especially if our anger creates problems for us
and our relationships, then we want to learn to examine our angry thoughts and see if
there might be another way of thinking about things. The Thought Record, which you
learned to use in Chapters 6–9, is a good tool for learning to think in alternative ways.
When we are angry, we tend to interpret or misinterpret other people’s intentions
in a personal and negative way. We may think that they are intentionally mistreating us
Understanding Your Anger, Guilt, and Shame 259
or taking advantage of us, even when this is not the case. For example, suppose you are
standing a few feet from the counter in a store, waiting for a clerk to finish with another
customer because you need help. As soon as the clerk finishes with that customer, someone else walks up to the counter and begins to talk to the clerk. If you think that this
person saw you and deliberately stepped in front of you, you might feel angry. If, on the
other hand, you thought that this was an honest mistake and the person did not see you
standing there, then you are less likely to feel angry. The difference between these two
reactions is whether we personalize the other person’s actions. Do we think they did this
“to us,” or was the other person unaware that we were standing there?
When we get angry, we tend to personalize other people’s actions. One of the
advantages of Thought Records is that they help you think through these types of situations. You can learn to ask yourself questions that help you consider other people’s
intentions. Thought Records can help you consider alternative explanations for other
people’s behavior. Can you remember a time when you stepped in front of someone else
who was waiting in line because you didn’t see that person standing there? You did not
intend to take advantage of the person. Instead, it was a simple mistake that everyone
makes from time to time. Learning to interpret other people’s actions less personally, to
consider the intentions of other people in a kinder way, and to look at situations from
different perspectives are helpful ways of responding to anger.
Angry thoughts often put people in boxes, so to speak. In the example earlier in
this chapter, Rick became very angry with John when John washed Rick’s shirt and it
shrank. Rick called John “careless” and “thoughtless.” We often label other people like
Rick did when we get angry. If these labels are used often enough, they become boxes
that block our flexible view of the other person’s intentions. If Rick continued to think
of John as “thoughtless,” then he might start to misinterpret many behaviors as proof
of this label. For example, if John walked into the kitchen and poured himself a cup of
coffee, Rick might think, “Oh, he’s so thoughtless. He didn’t offer me a cup.” Rick did
not consider that John knew that Rick never drank more than one cup of coffee and he’d
already had one cup that morning. John was not being thoughtless, but was demonstrating his attentiveness to Rick’s habits. In fact, John thought of himself as attentive and
caring, and his behavior generally backed this up. Putting a person in a box with a single
label on it usually results in lots of misinterpretations and unnecessary upset.
If you find yourself labeling and judging someone in your life in a consistent way,
this is often a sign that you have put this person in a box. When you become aware of
this, there are several things you can do to reduce your anger and open up the box.
First, you can be aware of your “hot button” issues that get pushed. Rick realized he
was very sensitive to signs that his feelings and needs are being ignored. When your hot
buttons get pushed, instead of reacting in an angry way, you can try to be a nonjudgmental observer and get more information, so you can test your assumptions about other
people’s intentions.
Rick wanted to improve his relationship with John. So rather than get silently angry
about John’s getting a cup of coffee for himself, Rick asked John, “Why didn’t you get
260 Mind Over Mood
me a cup of coffee?” This gave Rick a chance to test his assumption that John was being
thoughtless. John replied, “I saw you already had a cup of coffee this morning, and I
know you never drink more than one cup. But if you want another, I’m happy to get
you one. I’ll make a fresh pot.” John’s reply gave Rick additional information and helped
him realize that John’s behavior was not “thoughtless” at all. The advantage of gathering
more information when we start to think negatively about others is that it often helps us
understand other people’s actions in new ways.
Other methods that may help you control your anger include anticipating and preparing for events that place you at high risk for experiencing anger, recognizing the early
warning signs of anger, timeouts, assertion training, and couple or family therapy.
Using Imagery to Anticipate and Prepare for Events
It can help to anticipate and prepare for situations in which you are likely to get angry.
Calming down before entering these situations prepares you to handle events that might
normally trigger anger. The imagery methods described in Chapter 14 (on pp. 244–245)
as ways to lower anxiety can also be used to prepare you for situations in which you are
at risk for losing your temper. In addition to using imagery to calm yourself, you can use
imagery to plan and prepare the types of responses you want to make.
It is best to use imagery before entering a situation in which you are at high risk for
losing your temper. You may find it helpful to imagine yourself saying what you want to
say, in the manner in which you want to say it, and getting the response you hope to get.
Just in case things don’t turn out as well as you hope, it may be helpful to imagine how
you can handle problems that might occur. Mentally rehearsing responses to challenging situations can help you feel more confident and less threatened if things go poorly.
In turn, this confidence can help you respond in effective and adaptive ways, rather than
simply erupting in anger when things don’t work out. Imagery works, in part, because
it helps you think through possible problem areas and design your response in advance.
Furthermore, it can be helpful to see yourself as effective and relaxed in a high-risk,
stressful situation. Finally, it is helpful to construct an ideal image of how you want to
respond; the image can help guide your responses in the actual situation.
If you can identify a situation that is going to be stressful and in which you are
at high risk for experiencing anger, you have the opportunity to plan, write out, and
rehearse exactly what you want to say and how you want to say it. This script can help
you develop a strategy targeted to what you want to achieve and enter the situation with
a greater degree of confidence.
Recognizing Early Warning Signs of Anger
In addition to the anticipation of situations in which you are likely to be angry, it can
be helpful to recognize the signs that you are becoming angry or that your anger is getting out of control. For many people, early warning signs of anger that might get out of
Understanding Your Anger, Guilt, and Shame 261
control include shakiness, muscle tension, clenched jaw, chest pressure, yelling, clenched
fists, and saying things that are not true. Some anger is OK – but when you recognize
that you are beginning to move into a destructive zone of anger, take a moment to
remind yourself of your options. You can choose to be angry, or to use timeouts or assertion as described below to calm down.
Timeouts
Timeouts can be an effective way to control your anger. Taking a timeout involves
removing yourself from the situation you are in when the early warning signs indicate
that your anger might get out of control. Taking a timeout helps you reclaim control
over yourself and over the situation. You can remind yourself what is important to you
and what you are trying to accomplish.
The effective use of timeouts involves recognizing the earliest signs that your anger
is interfering with how you want to handle the situation or is becoming destructive.
You can use timeouts as athletes do: to regroup, strategize, relax, or simply rest. Your
timeout may be as short as 5 minutes or as long as 24 hours. The timeout is not used to
avoid a situation, but rather to enable you to approach the situation from a new angle
and with a fresh start. At times, merely getting out of the situation will help you to view
it differently. During the timeout, you may also find it helpful to practice the relaxation
exercises described in Chapter 14 (on p. 243). You may find that you get the most out
of a timeout when you use it to test some of your angry thoughts (as described earlier in
this chapter and in Chapters 6–9). Some people try to reenter the situation with a new
strategy in mind, to minimize the possibility of an angry blowup. As described earlier,
you can use imagery to practice what you plan to say and do before you go back into
the situation.
Assertion
Learning to be assertive can reduce difficulties with anger. Assertion is often described
as the middle road between being aggressive and passively allowing someone to take
advantage of us. When we are aggressive, we attack the other person. When we are
overly passive, we allow others to attack us. Assertion describes a middle road in which
we stand up for ourselves without attacking the other person. For example, here are
three responses to someone who calls us “stupid.”
Aggressive: (shouting) “If you think I’m stupid, you are an idiot!”
Assertive: (calm and firm) “You might think I’m stupid, but let’s get back to the real
issue, which is XYZ.”
Passive: (hanging head, saying nothing)
262 Mind Over Mood
Assertion also means expressing wants and needs in a straightforward way. For
example, suppose you are coming home from work, and your children all start asking
for your attention at once. If you are tired and try to satisfy all their needs (passive), you
may start feeling overwhelmed and eventually blow up in anger at them (aggressive).
It is often better to be assertive and say something like this: “I’m really tired and need
a few minutes to myself before I can play with you.” This gives you time to regroup,
remember how much you love your children, and prepare yourself for spending time
with them and/or setting limits as necessary. In this way, assertion can reduce the frequency of being treated unfairly or being taken advantage of, and therefore can prevent
situations that give rise to anger. It also gives you a greater sense of control in your
life.
Four Strategies to Help You Plan and Practice Assertive Responses
1. Use “I” statements. Angry statements tend to begin with the word “you” and
express blame for problems (e.g., “You always think of yourself first”). Starting a conversation in this way often puts the other person on the defensive, and the person is then
less likely to hear what you have to say. Assertive responses often begin with “I” and
express your reactions, needs, and wishes (e.g., “I really would like you to listen to what
I’m thinking and feeling”). Expressing a need or request is more likely to lead the other
person to hear your message, and is thus more likely to lead to a productive conversation.
2. Acknowledge any truth in someone’s complaints about you, and at the
same time stand up for your own rights. For example, imagine that someone asks
you to do something, and you say no. The other person then says, “But I really need
you to do this for me, and it seems selfish for you not to help out if you can.” You might
reply, “I understand you are disappointed, and yet I need to say no, because I am really
tired right now. That is not being selfish; it is just taking care of myself.”
3. Make clear and simple statements of your wants and needs, rather than
expecting other people to read your mind or anticipate what you want. It
is assertive to ask directly for help, tell others what you need, and be clear about your
expectations. You might tell your partner, “My feet are hurting. Would you please give
me a foot massage?” A mother might say to her children, “Please pick up all your toys
and put them away. When I come back, I expect the floor to be clear.” Or a manager
might say, “I need you to have this project done by 3 o’clock today. Please let me know
if anything interferes with meeting that deadline.”
4. Focus on the process of assertion rather than results. Being assertive
doesn’t mean that you will always get what you ask for. The goal of assertion is clear
communication. Even though there is no guarantee that each assertive statement will
lead to a desired outcome, consistent assertive communication is likely to lead over time
to more positive relationships.
Understanding Your Anger, Guilt, and Shame 263
Thoughts and Assumptions That Interfere with Being Assertive
“If you really like/love me, then you will know what I need.”
“People won’t like me if I say no.”
“Why bother? I’m not going to get what I want anyhow.”
“It’s not worth the argument it is going to create.”
“I can live with this the way it is.”
“If someone is not speaking nicely to me, I don’t need to respond nicely.”
These assumptions can be harmful to relationships. People who care deeply about
us often do not know what we want or need. The assumption that people should know
without our saying anything leads to frequent hurt and anger. Making clear and simple
statements about your wants and needs is a good relationship skill and often reduces the
hurt and irritation that can lead to anger.
If these types of thoughts interfere with your assertion, you can test them by using
the skills taught in Chapters 6–9. You can also test your thoughts and the usefulness of
assertion by doing behavioral experiments as taught in Chapter 11.
Forgiving Others
When someone has deeply or repeatedly hurt us, anger can last a long time. Ongoing
anger can eat away at our spirit and prevent us from experiencing happiness and joy. In
this case, finding a way to let go of anger may be worthwhile. Forgiving others who
have hurt us can help us let go of anger and hurt. If the person who hurt us is sorry and
apologizes, forgiveness is a bit easier. However, if the person is not sorry for what has
been done or said, then forgiveness is often more difficult. It is helpful to keep in mind
that forgiveness is about relieving ourselves of the burden of anger. It does not mean
overlooking the actions of the other person; it means looking at those actions in a different way. For example, we might accept that the person who hurt us is troubled or has
his or her own issues to work out.
Sometimes we may decide not to forgive someone, such as when someone continues abusing us or those we care about. In this case, the only way to let go of anger may
be to accept that the other person is abusive, be clear in our own minds that we are
not to blame, and figure out ways to protect ourselves from future abuse. Action Plans,
described in Chapter 10, can help us design a series of actions and responses to protect
ourselves from abuse. Sometimes this includes putting distance between ourselves and
the abusive person.
If you decide you want to forgive someone, here are two approaches that can help.
Remember that you can engage in this process of forgiveness for your own sake, and not
for the benefit of the other person. In fact, you do not even need to communicate your
264 Mind Over Mood
forgiveness to the other person. Option 2 below (writing a forgiveness letter) can foster
forgiveness even if you are no longer in contact with the person who hurt you.
1. Directly tell other people how they have hurt you, in order to help
them understand why you are angry. If you use “I” statements as described in the
section on assertion above, the other person has a chance to consider your perspective
and respond. For example, you might say to a spouse or a good friend, “I feel like an outsider when you don’t introduce me to your friends. When you continue to do this, even
though we have talked about it many times, I get the message that you really don’t care
about my feelings.” If the other person apologizes, you can decide either to forgive the
person or to talk about what future changes you need in order to forgive. For example,
you might say, “I want to believe you and forgive you. If you introduce me to some of
your friends over the next month, this will begin to show me that you really do care,
and it will make it easier for me to stop feeling hurt and angry.”
2. Write a forgiveness letter describing the hurt or damage that was done
to you. This is a letter that you are not going to send. It is important not to censor your
thoughts as you write the letter. Also, do not think about how the other person would
react if she or he ever read the letter. This letter of forgiveness is for you – not for the
person you are forgiving. Therefore, you can write the letter with full freedom, because
the person who hurt you is never going to read it.
Exercise: Writing a Forgiveness Letter
Use Worksheet 15.4 as a guide to help you write your forgiveness letter. It is not easy to forgive
those who have mistreated us, but it can be instrumental in healing deep wounds and letting go
of anger. If you are not ready at this point to write a forgiveness letter, that is fine. Just skip over
this exercise and section, and perhaps come back to these pages at another time – if you choose
to do so.

Exercise: Rating Anger Management Strategies
So far, you have learned how testing angry thoughts, preparing for events with imagery, recognizing
early warning signs of anger, timeouts, assertion, and forgiveness can help you manage your anger. Try
some of these anger management methods to see which ones work best for you. To figure this out, use
Worksheet 15.5 to rate your level of anger on a 0–100 scale before and after using them. Once you identify the one or two methods that work best for you, start using them regularly. The more you practice,
the more likely it is that you will be able to use these strategies effectively when you need them.
Worksheet 15.5. Ratings for My Anger Management Strategies
Under “Anger Management Method,” write “Testing thoughts,” “Imagery preparation,” “Recognizing early
warning signs,” “Timeout,” “Assertion,” or “Forgiveness.” For each of your practice sessions, rate your anger on a
0–100 scale, where 0 is none at all and 100 is the most ever, both before and after the exercise. Do a number of
practice sessions with each of the methods you want to try. At the bottom of the worksheet, make some comments about what you learn. See if your anger management skills improve with practice, and also compare the
different methods to learn which ones work best for you.

Understanding Your Anger, Guilt, and Shame 267
Couple or Family Therapy
For some people, anger mostly occurs with family members. If the anger management
strategies described above do not help you handle anger in your closest relationships,
couple or family therapy can help. Your perceptions, attitudes, beliefs, and thoughts about
your partner, your children, or other family members can fuel your anger. Therapy can
teach you how to communicate better, increase positive interactions in your relationships, and to develop negotiation skills. It can also help you learn strategies for identifying and altering expectations and rules. These skills can reduce anger and improve the
quality of your relationships.
Guilt and Shame
Guilt and shame are closely connected emotions. We tend to feel guilty when we believe
we have violated rules that are important to us, or when we have not lived up to standards that we have set for ourselves. We feel guilty when we judge that we have done
something wrong. If we think we “should” have behaved differently or that we “ought”
to have done better, we are likely to feel guilt.
Shame also involves the sense that we have done something wrong. However, when
we feel ashamed, we assume that what we have done wrong means that we are “flawed,”
“no good,” “inadequate,” “rotten,” “awful,” or “bad.” Shame is usually connected to a
highly negative view of ourselves. Secretiveness often surrounds shame. We may think,
“If others knew this secret, they would be disgusted with me or think less of me.” For
this reason, the source of shame is rarely revealed and remains hidden and destructive.
Shame often accompanies a family secret involving other family members – a secret such
as alcoholism, sexual abuse, abortion, bankruptcy, or other behavior considered dishonorable in the community.
Marissa was ashamed that she had been sexually abused. Although the abuse had
begun when she was 6 years old, Marissa never fully revealed the extent of her abuse until
she was 26 years old. She had attempted to tell her mother about the abuse when she was
younger, but was scolded and accused of lying. Whenever Marissa had memories of the
sexual abuse, she was overwhelmed by feelings of shame. While in therapy, Marissa filled
out Worksheet 15.3 on page 257. Her worksheet demonstrated the connection between
her thoughts and her shame (Figure 15.2 on p. 268). This example demonstrates the
secretive nature of shame (“I could never tell Julie this happened . . . ”), as well as how
shame was connected to Marissa’s view of herself as “awful” and “despicable.”
Overcoming Guilt and Shame
Overcoming guilt and shame does not necessarily mean letting yourself off the hook
if you believe you have done something wrong. It does mean taking an appropriate
amount of responsibility and coming to terms with whatever led you to feel this way.
268 Mind Over Mood
There are five aspects to overcoming guilt and shame: assessing the seriousness of your
actions, weighing personal responsibility, making reparations for any harm you caused,
breaking the silence surrounding shame, and self-forgiveness. Often only one or two
of these exercises are necessary to help in overcoming guilt. Overcoming shame may
require working on all five aspects.
Assessing the Seriousness of Your Actions
We can feel guilty or ashamed about both large and small actions. How would you compare the seriousness of these three actions on Toby’s part?

Understanding Your Anger, Guilt, and Shame 269
1. Toby was tired at the end of the day. Her phone rang, and she decided not to
answer it, because she didn’t feel like talking to anyone. She heard her mother’s voice on
the answering machine saying, “Toby, are you there? I want to tell you about my vacation.” Toby didn’t answer the phone.
2. After Toby’s mother had left her message, the phone rang again. When Toby
heard her best friend’s voice on the answering machine, she picked up the phone and
chatted for 10 minutes.
3. The next day Toby told her mother that she had not been home when her mother
called the night before.
Toby’s three experiences describe fairly small events. Yet many people would judge
the seriousness of these events differently. For which of these three events would you be
likely to feel guilty? Why?
Your evaluation of the seriousness of an action or thought depends on your own
rules and values. Many people say that they would feel guiltier about lying to their mothers (example 3) than about not answering the phone (example 1). Some people may feel
equally guilty in all three examples.
Frequent guilt and shame mean either that you are living your life in a way that violates your principles (e.g., having an affair when you believe in monogamous marriage),
or that you are judging too many small actions as serious. To evaluate the seriousness
of your actions leading to guilt and shame, you can answer the questions in the Helpful
Hints on page 270. These questions encourage you to look at the situation from different perspectives. This will be particularly helpful if you tend to feel guilt or shame in
many situations, even when others with similar values do not feel that way. Perspectiveshifting questions can help you evaluate the seriousness of your actions. Ask yourself,
“How important will this seem in five years?” Having an affair will almost certainly
still seem like a big violation of a monogamous relationship in five years. Arriving home
late for dinner three nights in a row will not seem important in five years, even if it is
a distressing event for you or your partner now. Therefore, lasting guilt about an affair
would make more sense than lasting guilt about arriving home late for dinner.

ExErCiSE: rating the Seriousness of My Actions
Using the questions in the Helpful Hints as a guide, rate how serious you think your actions are
on the Worksheet 15.6 scales. Since people have diff erent values and beliefs about what is right
and wrong, you should fi rst make the endpoints personal to you. At the 100 mark on the scale at
the top of the worksheet, write the most serious wrong action you could imagine a person doing.
For example, this might be to torture and murder someone. While 0 would not be serious at all,
10 might be something like not returning a small amount of extra change you were overpaid in a
store.
Label a few marks on the scale at the top of Worksheet 15.6 so that you see the diff erences
among minor, medium, and serious actions that you might feel guilt or shame about. Then think
of the worst thing you have ever done in your life. Assuming that it is less serious than torture and
murder, put that action on the scale where you think it belongs.
Once you have created your personal scale, use it to rate the seriousness of actions that
prompt you to feel guilt or shame.

272 Mind Over Mood
Weighing Personal Responsibility
Once you have assessed the seriousness of your actions, it is helpful to weigh how much
of your perceived wrongdoing is your personal responsibility. Marissa felt ashamed that
she was molested as a child. The molestation was certainly a serious event in her life,
but was she responsible for it? Vic felt guilty that he blew up in anger at his wife, Judy,
one night when she started complaining about their overdue credit card bills. Was he
responsible for his angry reaction?
A good way to weigh personal responsibility is to construct a “responsibility pie.”
To do this, list all the people and aspects of a situation that contributed to an event about
which you feel guilty or ashamed. Include yourself on the list. Then draw a circle to
represent a pie, and assign slices of the responsibility for the event in sizes that reflect
relative responsibility. Draw your own slice last, so that you do not prematurely assign
too much responsibility to yourself.
Figure 15.3 shows what people and things Marissa identified as partly responsible
for her sexual molestation and how she completed her first responsibility pie. Although
Marissa had always felt personally responsible for being molested, when she filled out a
responsibility pie, she gave herself a very small part of the responsibility. She decided that
she felt responsible only for not saying no to her dad. Most of the responsibility for what
happened was her father’s, and even the slices representing her mother, grandfather, and
alcohol were larger than Marissa’s.
When Marissa showed her responsibility pie to her therapist, they discussed further
her “responsibility” for the molestation. After a number of sessions, Marissa came to
understand and believe that she was not at all responsible for being molested. She learned
that molestation is entirely an adult responsibility; like most children, she did not have
the knowledge or security to say no at age 6 or even at age 13. When she did finally say
no at age 14, the molestation stopped. But stopping her father at age 14 did not mean

that she had had the ability to do this all along. Her father might have been unwilling
to risk confrontation with her as an older child. But he would have had no trouble overpowering her when she was younger. Even if she had said no when she was younger, it
probably would not have stopped him. Even when older children and adolescents say
no to sexual molestation, they are often ignored. The responsibility pie helped relieve
Marissa of her guilt.
Vic completed a responsibility pie (Figure 15.4) when he felt guilty about yelling at
his wife, Judy, after she complained to him about overdue credit card bills. This was a
serious violation of his promise to Judy that he would not attack her in anger. Although
he did not hit or shove Judy, he physically intimidated her by standing close to her and
shouting in her face.
As you see, Vic decided that he was primarily responsible for his angry outburst.
Although Judy, their debts, and his late work hours contributed to his anger, he felt that
he could have handled the situation in a less intimidating fashion. Therefore, Vic decided
that he should make reparations to Judy for what he had done. This incident also confirmed for Vic that he needed to change his anger responses.
As the examples of Marissa and Vic illustrate, responsibility pies can help you evaluate the level of responsibility of each of the contributors to a situation. A responsibility
pie is not designed to always reduce guilt. Sometimes it is healthy to feel guilty about
what we have done. In these instances, we can take steps to make amends for harm we
have done to others. We can also come up with a plan to help ourselves respond in ways
that are closer to our values. People who often feel guilty over small things find that
responsibility pies help them recognize that they are not 100% responsible for the undesirable things that happen. People who feel guilt or shame when they have caused harm
to others can use a responsibility pie to evaluate their role in any damage that was done
before making reparations.

Making Reparations
If you have injured another person, it is important to make amends for your actions.
Trying to repair the damage you have done can be an important component in healing
yourself and the relationship. Making amends involves recognizing what you did, being
courageous enough to face the person you have hurt, asking forgiveness, and determining what you can do to repair the hurt you caused.

276 Mind Over Mood
Notice that Worksheet 15.8 focuses on your making amends, not on the other person’s forgiving you. You can ask someone to forgive you “in time,” but this is no guarantee that the person will do so, especially if you have hurt this person very deeply or
many times. However, making amends can help you feel better, especially when you are
truly sorry, make some change in your behavior to try to be a better person, and make an
effort to make amends to the person you hurt. Your attempts to be a better person brings
you closer to acting within your values, and this can help you feel better about yourself.
Breaking the Silence Surrounding Shame
When secretiveness surrounds shame, it may be important to talk to a trusted person
about what occurred. The need to keep silent is often based on the expectation that
revealing your secret will result in condemnation, criticism, or rejection. It is not unusual
for people who have carried a secret for a lifetime to be surprised at the acceptance they
receive when they reveal their secret. Acceptance runs counter to the anticipated rejection and forces a reassessment of the meaning of your secret.
Although you may not trust anyone fully, it is important to reveal your secret to the
people you trust the most. You may tell people how anxious it makes you feel to reveal
your secret and how difficult it is for you to do. Be sure to talk to someone at a time and
place when you will have adequate time to say everything you need to say, and to talk
about the feedback you get.
Even though Petra was a successful administrative assistant for a large company, she
hid the fact that she failed and was kicked out of her university after her first year as a
student. This followed a wild period in her youth during which she partied much of the
time and was using illegal drugs. Now, as a respected working adult, she told people that
she had never had the financial opportunity to study at a university. Petra felt ashamed
about her younger behavior and even more ashamed of her school failure. She worried
that people would judge her negatively if they knew. This weighed heavily on her, especially when others talked about drug use or their children’s university graduations.
One night Petra went out to dinner with her closest friend, Monique. They were
talking about mistakes they had made when they were younger. Monique told the story
of one man she had dated who was quite scary when he drank. She told Petra that sometimes she had a hard time accepting what poor judgment she had in staying with him
for as long as she did. Petra swallowed hard and decided to take a risk. She started out by
telling her friend that she had used some drugs when she was a teenager. Petra was surprised that Monique did not seem to judge her for this, but instead said, “So many people
our age did that back then.” This response encouraged Petra to tell Monique more

details about her wild youth. By the end of the hour, she revealed her shame about failing and being kicked out of school. Petra was surprised that Monique was understanding
and sympathetic toward her experiences. Instead of being critical, Monique expressed
appreciation for how much Petra had accomplished in her life after such a rocky start.
After this evening, Petra felt even closer to Monique than she had before. She began to
view her youthful failures with less shame.
Self-Forgiveness
Being a good person doesn’t mean that you will never do bad things. Part of being
human is making mistakes. If, after careful evaluation, you conclude that you have done
some things wrong, then self-forgiveness may help alleviate your guilt or shame.
No one is perfect. All of us, at one point or another, have violated our own principles or standards. We feel guilty and ashamed if we believe that what we did means
that we are bad. But violations do not necessarily mean that we are bad. Just as in Petra’s
case, our actions may have been linked to a particular situation or to a specific time in
our lives.
Self-forgiveness can lead to a change in interpretation of the meaning of the violation or mistake we made. Our understanding may change from “I made this mistake
because I’m an awful person,” to “I made this mistake during an awful time in my life,
when I didn’t care if I behaved this way.”
Just as in the forgiveness letter you wrote to someone else in Worksheet 15.4, selfforgiveness does not mean that you approve, forget, or deny whatever pain you have
caused others. Instead, self-forgiveness involves recognizing your own imperfections and
mistakes and accepting your shortcomings. It can also help if you see that your life has
not been one mistake or harmful action after another. Self-forgiveness includes recognizing your good and bad qualities, your strengths as well as weaknesses.
Exercise: Forgiving Myself
Some people have great difficulty forgiving themselves; they may have harsh and critical internal
voices. If you are able to forgive others for their faults, but you have a hard time forgiving yourself,
you can benefit from practicing self-forgiveness. This involves learning to view yourself with the
same kindness or compassion with which you view others. Worksheet 15.9 on the next page can
guide you through this process.
278
Worksheet 15.9. Forgiving Myself
1. This is what I need to forgive myself for:
2. This is the impact that what I did has had on me and others in my life:
3. This is how it continues to affect me and others:
4. This is how I imagine my life will be better if I’m able to forgive myself:
5. Forgiveness often begins with understanding. What life experiences have I had that might have contributed
to what I did?
6. How would I think about someone else who did this?
7. What positive aspects of myself and my life do I tend to ignore when I’m feeling guilt or shame?
8. Forgiveness does not mean that you condone, forget, or deny what was done and the pain you have experienced. Instead, forgiveness means finding a way to let go of your guilt and shame, and understand your
actions from a different perspective. Write with a kind, compassionate voice about how I can forgive myself
for what I have done:
9. These are the qualities that I have that will allow me to move forward:

Understanding Your Anger, Guilt, and Shame 279
When You Complete This Chapter
Once you have completed this chapter, return to Chapter 5 to set goals and identify signs
of improvement that are meaningful to you. You will learn additional skills to help you
manage your anger, guilt, and shame in Chapters 6–12.
Chapter 15 Summary
X As you practice Mind Over Mood skills, Worksheets 15.1 and 15.2 help you rate
and track your progress in the frequency, strength, and duration of your moods.
X Anger is characterized by muscle tension, increased heart rate, increased blood
pressure, and defensiveness or attack.
X When we are angry, our thoughts focus on our perceptions that other people
are hurting us, threatening us, breaking the rules, or being unfair.
X Anger can range from mild irritation to rage. How angry we feel is influenced by
our interpretation of the meaning of events, our expectations for other people,
and whether or not we thought the other persons’ behavior was intentional or
not.
X Methods that are effective in controlling anger include testing angry thoughts,
using imagery to anticipate and prepare for events in which you are at high
risk for anger, recognizing the early warning signs of anger, timeouts, assertion,
forgiveness, and couple or family therapy.
X We feel guilty when we believe that we have done something wrong or not
lived up to the standards we have set for ourselves.
X Guilt is often accompanied by thoughts containing the words “should” or
“ought.”
X Shame involves the perception that we have done something wrong, that we
need to keep it a secret, and that what we have done means something terrible
about us.
X Guilt and shame can be lessened or eliminated by assessing the seriousness of
your actions, weighing personal responsibility, making reparations for any harm
you caused, breaking the silence surrounding shame, and self-forgiveness.

Maintaining Your Gains
and Experiencing
More Happiness
A wise fisherman, while fishing off the end of a pier, was approached by a hungry
woman who hadn’t eaten anything for several days. Eyeing the basket of fish he had
caught, the woman begged him to give her some fish to satisfy her hunger. After thinking for a moment, the fisherman replied, “I’m not going to give you any of my fish, but
if you sit down next to me and pick up a pole, I’ll teach you how to fish. That way you
will not only eat today, but you will learn how to feed yourself for the rest of your life.”
The woman took the fisherman’s advice, learned to fish, and never went hungry again.
Just as learning the skill of fishing helped the woman in this story, the Mind Over
Mood skills you have practiced and learned can help you today and for the rest of your
life. This final chapter asks you to review what you have learned through using Mind
Over Mood, and to determine how you can use these skills to continue improving your
life.
If you have worked this far into the book, it is likely that your moods have improved.
You probably can use many Mind Over Mood skills with confidence. People learn these
skills in three stages. In the first stage, you apply skills in a conscious and deliberate way
(writing out Thought Records, filling out weekly Activity Schedules, planning behavioral experiments, etc.). The second stage in the development of Mind Over Mood skills
begins when you have used the skills often enough that you are now able to carry them
 Maintaining Your Gains and experiencing More Happiness 281
out in your head, without the worksheets, but still with deliberate and conscious effort.
The fi nal stage begins when you have practiced these skills so much that they begin to
occur automatically, without any conscious or deliberate effort. For example, you might
have the automatic thought “I’m such a failure,” and then quickly think, “Wait a minute.
I messed this up, but that doesn’t make me a failure.” And then later, in this same situation, you might simply think, “Oh, I messed this up,” without any thought at all about
being a failure. This is when your new ways of thinking and behaving have become
ingrained and automatic.
helPFUl
hInts
Often when we start to feel better, we stop using the skills that
helped us get to that point. It is actually better to keep deliberately
using helpful skills until they become automatic.
Even when you begin to use Mind Over Mood skills automatically, you can anticipate
that you will still sometimes feel the same moods that led you to use this book. Experiencing a variety and intensity of moods is a normal and valuable part of life. At the same
time, you want to be alert to notice if normal mood fl uctuations turn into what is called
a “relapse.” The word “relapse” applies when your moods become more severe, last too
long, occur too frequently, or begin to have negative effects on your life or relationships.
Most mood diffi culties can be successfully helped. If you are doing the exercises in
this book, and you are not improving or you relapse frequently, don’t give up hope. Perhaps you will get better when you try alternative forms of help. For example, you may
want to consult a mental health care professional for additional guidance. This is also
recommended if you feel so poorly that you struggle to use this book because you can’t
concentrate or remember what you are reading.
If you have improved through using Mind Over Mood skills, and then a relapse occurs,
you want to be prepared to recognize your setback as soon as possible. It is helpful to
view your setback as an opportunity to strengthen your skills. The earlier you apply
your Mind Over Mood skills to whatever diffi culty you are facing, the more quickly you
will feel better again. If your moods begin to get worse, it is a good idea to go back to
the deliberate and effortful application of the skills that helped you get better in the fi rst
place. You may be surprised to fi nd that when you consciously start using skills again,
they help more quickly than when you fi rst learned them. This is because you are not
learning something new, but refreshing what you already know. This is just like when
you ride a bicycle after you have not been on one for a long time: It may seem a little
awkward at fi rst, but you quickly remember what you know how to do.

Exercise: Reviewing and Rating Mind Over Mood Skills
This chapter guides you through steps you can take to continue to benefit from and build on the Mind
Over Mood skills you have learned so far to prevent and manage relapse. As a springboard for this planning, fill out Worksheet 16.1. This worksheet lists the skills taught in Mind Over Mood. Use the 0–3 rating
scale at the top of the worksheet to rate each skill on how often you have used it, how often it is helpful when you use it, how often you still use it, and how much you think you might use this skill in the
future. Don’t worry if you haven’t mastered all these skills. You may have forgotten you practiced some
of them. There may be some skills you skipped while reading this book. You may be using other skills
so automatically now that you forgot you learned them. The Skills Checklist reminds you that there are
many different tools available to help you manage your moods.
Worksheet 16.1. Mind Over Mood Skills Checklist
For each skill listed, there are four rating categories: Used = Did you use this skill?; Helpful = How often was it
helpful?; Still use = Do you still use this skill?; Future use = Do you think you will use this skill in the future?
Rate each skill in all four categories using the following scale:
0 = Not at all   1 = Sometimes   2 = Frequently   3 = Most of the time

One of the purposes of Worksheet 16.1 is to highlight Mind Over Mood
skills you have learned. The improvement you have made is a result of
your effort and the new skills you have developed. You can go forward
with confi dence that no one can take these skills away from you. In
fact, you will learn to use your skills in many more situations over
time. As you do, you are less likely to struggle with future mood problems and more likely to experience happiness and fi nd positive purpose
and meaning in your life.
REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF RELAPSE
Sometimes we stop using skills because we are feeling better. At other times, old thinking and behaviors return despite our best efforts, and we begin to experience more frequent, severe, longer- lasting, and disruptive negative moods. As bad as this feels, it can
be an opportunity to further develop our skills and help them become more automatic.
As described earlier in this chapter, if we notice these relapses early and take action, we
have a good chance of improving our moods quickly.
The following three steps will reduce the likelihood of relapse:
1. Identify high-risk situations. As you have worked through the exercises in
this book, you may have noticed that you are more likely to struggle with problematic
moods in certain situations. Linda was more likely to feel anxious on airplanes and when
Worksheet 16.1 (continued from previous page)
286 Mind Over Mood
her heart started racing. Ben was prone to feeling depressed when it seemed that his children and grandchildren didn’t need him. Vic’s anger flared when he thought that people
weren’t supporting him. Marissa became more depressed when she thought that people
didn’t care about her or were taking advantage of her. On Worksheet 16.2 (see p. 288),
list some situations that may be high-risk for you in terms of the moods you have been
targeting.
2. Identify early warning signs. Whether you are in high-risk situations or not,
it is good to be aware that most of us have early warning signs that we are sinking into
deeper and more problematic mood states. For example, Ben became quite active again
with friends and family members when his depression lifted. He noticed, however, that
whenever his mood dipped for a few days, he ignored phone calls and thought about
ways to avoid getting together with friends and family. When Ben stopped answering
phone calls and looked for reasons not to see people, he recognized these as early warning signs that his depression might be returning.
Your early warning signs may be behaviors that you do or don’t do (e.g., staying
in bed longer, procrastinating more, avoiding situations or people), thoughts (negative,
worried, self-critical), moods (a rise in Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory or Anxiety Inventory scores, increased irritability), and/or physical changes (difficulty sleeping, fatigue, muscle tension, appetite change). Think back over your past experiences.
What might be your early warning signs? If you are not aware of any, try asking family
members or friends if they have any ideas. Write down your early warning signs on
Worksheet 16.2.
For most of us, identifying early warning signs will include regular measurement of
our moods, even after we are feeling better. If you were depressed or anxious in the past,
you can fill out the Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory and/or Anxiety Inventory
on a monthly basis as part of your early warning monitoring system. For other moods,
you can rate their frequency, strength, and duration periodically on a 0–100 scale, as
you learned to do on Worksheet 15.1 in Chapter 15. A good time to put your plan to
reduce relapse risk into effect is when your mood scores begin to increase in frequency,
strength, and/or duration.
Maintaining Your Gains and Experiencing More Happiness 287
3. Prepare a plan of action. One of the advantages of learning mood management skills is that you can use these during challenging times to help you understand,
tolerate, and reduce your distress. In the third section of Worksheet 16.2 on page 288,
you consider which skills, values, and beliefs you hold that can help you during highrisk situations and when you begin to get early warning signs that certain moods are
becoming problematic again. Think about what you have learned in Mind Over Mood
that helped you get better. The learning that was most important to you is identified on
Worksheet 16.1 (pp. 282–285), so review your answers there when you are developing a
plan to prevent and/or recover from relapse.
Write down on Worksheet 16.2 the skills and steps you can take in high-risk situations, and when you have early warning signs of worsening moods. For example, when
Ben noticed himself withdrawing from his family and friends (his early warning sign),
he reviewed Worksheet 16.1 and realized that he had benefited the most from his Activity Schedule (Worksheet 13.6). Therefore, he wrote on his Plan to Reduce Relapse Risk
that he would be more active, get out of the house more, and make plans to be around
other people. Also, after reviewing Worksheet 16.1, Ben recognized that another important part of his improvement resulted from learning to think differently. This came
about from his use of Thought Records and a gratitude journal.
Because Ben had filled out Thought Records for several months, he had developed
the ability to respond automatically to negative thoughts with more balanced thoughts,
without consciously thinking about it or needing to write anything down. Ben anticipated that he might not be able to automatically respond to his negative thoughts if his
depression came back. Therefore, he also made a plan to fill out Thought Records again
if his Mind Over Mood Depression Inventory scores rose above 15. He planned to continue testing his thoughts on paper until his scores dropped below 10.
When he kept his gratitude journal, Ben recognized the importance of his family
and friends. As he realized how fortunate he was to have so many good people in his life,
he felt happier, and his activities became more meaningful to him. As part of his relapse
management plan, therefore, Ben decided to review and add to his gratitude journal on
a weekly basis. He also planned to express his appreciation about something to at least
one person every week.

Exercise: Reducing Relapse Risk
Worksheet 16.2 helps you reduce your risk of relapse by:

289
Exercise: Imagine Yourself Coping
It can help to practice your plan from Worksheet 16.2 before you need it. One way to do this
is to imagine one of your high-risk situations occurring in the future. Imagine this situation in
great detail. What is happening? What do you see and hear? Next, imagine you are experiencing several or all of your early warning signs. How do you feel? What are you thinking? What are
you doing? Now imagine putting your plan of action into effect. Spend several minutes imagining doing each step of your plan in detail. As you carry out each step in your imagination,
pay attention to what you are doing, thinking, and feeling. How does this affect your mood?
Thoughts? Behavior? Physical experience?
Based on this imagination exercise, how confident are you (low, medium, or high) that the plan
of action you wrote in section 3 of Worksheet 16.2 will be enough to help you feel better again
if you start to relapse? If your confidence level is high, then your plan is probably a good one. If
you confidence in your plan is low, then you want to think about what else you can add to it that
will boost your likelihood of managing future challenges. If you think the plan is a good one,
but you lack confidence in your skills to carry it out, the best thing to do is to continue practicing the skills in your plan of action even when you are feeling well. Ideally, you want most of
your relapse reduction skills to be fairly automatic when you are doing well, so that you can rely
on them to help you if you begin to feel worse.
Keep Mind Over Mood Where You Will See It
You have probably been using this book and practicing the skills on a regular basis. If
you are feeling better now, you may tend to put the book aside, especially if you have
completed reading most or all of it. Actually, it is better to continue to refer to this book,
even if you are no longer using it as regularly as you were. For example, if you have been
using it daily, it is helpful to keep the book somewhere you are likely to see it, so you
remember to periodically review what you learned (e.g., once a week for a few months).
If you have been using this book once a week, you might refer to it every few weeks
or once a month for a number of months. Research shows that people who review and
continue to practice what they have learned are less likely to relapse than are those who
stop their practice.
UsE Mind Over Mood to Enhance Your Life and Experience
Greater Happiness
Most people use Mind Over Mood skills at first to help with moods that trouble them,
such as depression, anxiety, anger, guilt, or shame. These same skills can also help you
develop greater happiness. Mind Over Mood skills operate like an elevator: They can lift
you out of the basement and take you not just to ground level, but up to the top floor.
For example, in Chapter 12 you learned to use a gratitude journal, express gratitude
to others, and act with kindness. These practices boost happiness. Chapter 14 describes
290 Mind Over Mood
how to use positive imagery to manage anxiety. Positive imagery can also be used to
imagine new ways you would like to be. When you actively imagine new behaviors, you
are more likely to carry them out. You can use positive imagery to help create positive
change in your life.
When you want to make positive changes, you can use Action Plans (Chapter 10) or
behavioral experiments (Chapter 11) to try out new ways of doing things and see what
works best for you. Practicing acceptance (Chapter 10) and mindfulness (Chapter 14)
are methods that can help you develop a greater sense of well-being. One of our recommended activities to reduce depression is to notice and enjoy small positive experiences
(Chapter 13). Savoring positive experiences when you are not depressed can help create greater life satisfaction. You also learned that it is important to engage in a variety
of activities when you are depressed (activities that are pleasurable, give you a sense of
accomplishment, help in overcoming avoidance, and fit with your values). When you
are feeling better, these same types of activities can help you create a life filled with satisfaction and well-being. Even though you may feel good now and may no longer feel
depressed, anxious, or angry, consider how you can continue to use Mind Over Mood
skills to take the elevator to the upper floors.

Chapter 16 Summary
X Learning Mind Over Mood skills progresses through three stages: conscious and
deliberate practice; being able to use skills in your head with conscious effort;
and finally having new behaviors and thinking processes occur automatically,
without planning or effort.
X People tend to stop using skills once their moods improve, and yet it is better to
continue practicing them until their use becomes automatic.
X Everyone can expect normal mood fluctuations. It is important to recognize
when these begin to become a “relapse” – that is, when moods become more
severe, last too long, occur too frequently, or begin to have negative effects on
your life or relationships.
X The Mind Over Mood Skills Checklist (Worksheet 16.1) highlights what skills you
have used, how often they help you, whether you still use them, and how often
you plan to use them in the future.
X The Mind Over Mood Skills Checklist also helps you understand that the
improvements you have made are the results of your efforts and the skills you
have built.
X To reduce your risk of relapse, it is helpful to identify your high-risk situations,
learn your warning signs, and make a plan of action based on the skills you now
possess.
X It is helpful to practice your relapse risk reduction plan in imagination when you
are feeling well, to test how confident you are that it will help you if you need it.
X Even after you finish reading Mind Over Mood, keep the book somewhere
you will see it, so you can remember what you have learned and continue to
practice the skills that help you feel better.
X The same activities and skills than lift you out of depression, anxiety, anger,
guilt, and shame can also help lift you into positive mood states once you feel
better.

Epilogue
Although you have read about many different people in this book, you have followed
in detail the progress of Ben, Linda, Marissa, and Vic. You may be curious to know
what happened to them. This Epilogue describes their lives as time went by.
Ben: Older and better.
Ben conquered his depression by testing his thoughts on Thought Records and by doing
experiments to learn new ways of interacting with his children and grandchildren. He
also found completing Activity Schedules and keeping a gratitude journal very helpful.
By the end of therapy, he felt much happier. He resumed meeting with his friends, tinkering with projects in his garage, and doing a variety of activities with his wife, Sylvie.
In addition, Ben and Sylvie talked about how they would each cope if the other died
first. While Ben hoped Sylvie would live as long as he, he felt more certain that he could
learn to enjoy his life even if she died first.
The dramatic improvement in his mood pleased and surprised Ben. He sprang up
from his chair at the end of his last therapy session and gave his therapist a firm handshake: “Thank you, Doctor. You’ve been a terrific help, and you know I didn’t believe
therapy could help.” Ben’s therapist smiled and told Ben, “Well, you deserve the credit.
You worked very hard to feel better.”
Ben had worked hard in therapy. Almost every day he made some attempt to feel
better. Some days he identified his moods and thoughts; other days he increased his
activities or experimented with new behaviors. As described in Chapter 13, Ben especially increased activities that gave him a sense of pleasure or accomplishment, and those
that led him to approach rather than avoid life challenges. Ben also paid attention to
what he valued most (i.e., family and friends) and made sure his activities kept him connected to them. Even with this consistent effort, Ben’s improvement varied from week
to week. Figure E.1 shows the graph of Ben’s depression scores on the Mind Over Mood
Depression Inventory (Worksheet 13.1) for the time he was in CBT.
Usually people do not improve every single week on a depression score graph. Notice
that Ben might have thought he wasn’t making any progress in week 3, when his depression score actually went up several points. But over time, Ben’s depression decreased,
 Epilogue 293
especially after week 6 when he learned to use Thought Records. Even though Ben’s
depression scores sometimes increased or stayed the same, over time he felt better.
Marissa: Finally my life seems worth living.
As you see from Marissa’s depression score chart (Figure E.2 on p. 294), her improvement pattern was quite different from Ben’s. Marissa’s depression scores went up and
down quite a lot over the time she was in therapy. During particularly difficult times
(e.g., when she was getting critical feedback at work, when she and her therapist were
discussing her childhood abuse, when Marissa became discouraged and stopped doing
Thought Records), her depression scores were higher (she was more depressed). As
Marissa improved her ability to use problem solving, Thought Records, and experiments, her depression scores were lower (she was less depressed).
At times, Marissa’s depression scores were as high as when she started therapy, but
you can see that her scores were mostly lower in the later weeks of therapy. In the first
ten weeks, Marissa’s depression scores were above 30 for seven weeks. In the next ten
weeks, Marissa’s scores were above 30 for only four weeks. In the next ten weeks, her
scores were above 30 in only one week. So, although Marissa continued to struggle with
depression for months, her chart helped her see that she had fewer very depressed weeks
as she practiced using Thought Records and the other skills she learned. As is often the
FIGURE E.1. Ben’s weekly depression scores.

depressed less often and that when she did experience worse moods, these were not as
severe and did not last as long.
At her most recent follow-up, Marissa had been using the strategies described in
Mind Over Mood for over three years. She was using the methods on her own now,
although she went back to see her therapist for help with problem solving when she
felt stuck. Marissa had not made any suicide attempts in the previous three years. She
no longer felt guilty or ashamed about her childhood abuse history. She had done well
in her job and received positive evaluations from her supervisor. Her second child had
entered college, and with both children living away from home, Marissa had moved to
a smaller apartment in a building where she could keep a garden. Marissa was living
alone for the first time in her life. She had made some new friends and felt more hope
for the future.
Linda: Frequent flyer.
As you learned in Chapter 11, Linda was successful in overcoming her panic attacks and
her fear of flying. Three key steps led to her success:

 Epilogue 295
1. Linda identified the physical sensations (e.g., rapid heart rate) that frightened her,
and her catastrophic fears (e.g., “I’m having a heart attack”) about these sensations.
2. With the help of her therapist, Linda constructed alternative explanations (e.g.,
a rapid heart rate can be caused by anxiety, excitement, or coffee) for the sensations she
experienced.
3. Linda did a number of experiments to gather information and to test whether her
catastrophic beliefs or alternative explanations matched her life experiences better. These
experiments were done in the therapist’s office, in imagery, at home, and on airplanes.
Over time, Linda became confident that the physical sensations she experienced
were fueled by anxiety, not physical danger. She learned and practiced a number of strategies for reducing her anxiety. She was flying with comfort a few months after beginning therapy.
Linda kept her job promotion and became regional supervisor for her company.
She was able to use the skills she learned in Mind Over Mood to identify and change her
thoughts and feelings in ways that helped her manage the additional pressures of her new
job.
Vic: The perfect solution – to be imperfect.
Vic initially went into treatment wanting to feel more confident, to feel better about
himself, to manage his anger, and to get help in maintaining his sobriety. As time passed,
some of Vic’s therapy goals changed. He remained steadfast in his commitment to sobriety. However, he began to realize that his problems with anger, depression, and anxiety
were threatening his marriage.
Vic addressed each of these issues in turn. His progress was characterized by hard
work, sustained effort, and steady improvement, interrupted by two episodes of binge
drinking and significant deterioration in his life. After completing approximately 35
Thought Records, Vic developed a good ability to identify and test the thoughts that
contributed to his moods, low self-esteem, and drinking. Anticipating difficult events
and using imagery to prepare for them helped Vic control his urges to drink and minimized the frequency of his anger outbursts.
Vic also used the Core Belief Record (Worksheet 12.6) to record evidence supporting his new sense of competence (Figure E.3 on p. 296).
After his second episode of binge drinking, Vic was successfully able to control his
urges to drink and maintain his sobriety. He attributed his sobriety to learning multiple
strategies to manage his moods in healthier ways. One of these strategies was learning to
recognize and shift the thoughts and beliefs that increased his negative moods and urges
to drink.
In addition, Vic and Judy decided that couple therapy would be helpful. Couple
therapy taught them how to improve their communication, express their feelings clearly,
and test the accuracy of their thoughts about each other. Furthermore, therapy helped
296 Mind Over Mood
Vic and Judy repair their trust, which had been weakened by years of anger and alcoholism.
As his therapy was coming to an end, Vic realized that he would continue to face
challenges on a daily basis. As part of his relapse management plan, Vic decided to write
out Thought Records periodically when he was unable to test out his thoughts in his
head. Rather than trying to be perfect, he worked on accepting his imperfections and
continued to gather and review the data on his new Core Belief Record to help him
stay aware of the ways he was competent. Vic attributed his ongoing sobriety, improved
marriage, and increased sense of happiness to these strategies and methods.
Change How You Feel by Changing the Way You Think
Chapter 1 of Mind Over Mood described how an oyster turns an irritant into a valuable
pearl. Our hope is that Mind Over Mood has helped you learn new skills to transform
irritants and problems in your life into new coping strategies and strengths. You are now
more capable of evaluating your thoughts, managing your moods, and changing your
life. We hope that you have resolved the problems that led you to Mind Over Mood, and
that in that resolution you have gained insight, understanding, skills, and methods to
transform future irritants into valuable pearls.
New Core Belief: I am competent.
Evidence or experiences that support my new belief:
1. My daughter and I visited a college she was considering attending. I helped her get
acquainted and ask questions. She told me she appreciated my help.                 
2. I helped my son with a science project he was working on. I didn’t do the project for him,
but I helped him think it through in a way that helped him do it himself.            
3. Judy expressed admiration for my continuing sobriety.                         
4. I sold products to four new accounts last month.                                
5. I was asked by the minister at my church to help organize a meeting for new church
members.                                                                
6. I attended an AA meeting Tuesday night when I felt like drinking.                   
7. I got my monthly reports in on time.                                 
8. I stayed calm when Judy and I were discussing our bills.

Exercise: Rating Confidence in New Core Beliefs over Time
On the first line of Worksheet 12.7, write the new core belief you identified and have been strengthening on Worksheet 12.6. Then enter the date and rate the new core belief by placing an × on the
scale above the number that best matches how much you think this new belief fits with your current experiences. If you don’t believe the new core belief at all, mark your × above 0 on the scale. If
you have total confidence in your new core belief, put your × above 100 on the scale. To measure
your progress in strengthening your new core belief, rerate the new core belief every few weeks.

Exercise: Rating Behaviors on a Scale instead of in All-or-Nothing Terms
On Worksheet 12.8, identify some of your own behaviors related to your new core belief. For example,
if you are trying to develop a new core belief that you are lovable, you might rate your social behavior
or things you do that you think would make you lovable. If you are trying to develop a new core belief
that “I am a worthwhile person,” you could focus on behaviors that you think demonstrate your worth.
Choose behaviors that you tend to evaluate in all-or-nothing terms. For each scale, describe the situation and write what behavior you are rating. Notice how it feels to rate your behavior on a scale instead
of evaluating yourself in all-or-nothing terms. After you have rated several behaviors on these scales,
summarize what you have learned at the bottom of Worksheet 12.8.

Exercise: Activity Scheduling
Before filling out Worksheet 13.6 on the next page, write down at least several activities you want to
plan for each day. You might find it helpful to review Worksheet 13.5 on page 208, especially your
answers to questions 3, 6, and 8. It is helpful to think of several activities in each of the following categories and spread them out throughout the week.
Pleasurable activities:
Activities that accomplish something:
What I can do to begin to approach things I have been avoiding:
Activities that fit with my values:
Some activities could fit in a variety of categories. For example, walking or exercising may be pleasurable for one person, may be an accomplishment for someone else, and may fit with a value of doing
healthy activities for yet another person. If you have been avoiding exercise for some time, it may even
be overcoming avoidance. Put activities in whatever category makes sense to you. The important thing
is to do activities in each of the four areas throughout the week.
322
Worksheet 13.6. Activity Schedule
Referring to the “Activity Scheduling” exercise (p. 213), use this worksheet to schedule some activities. Write down the times and days of the week you
plan to do these activities. If something more enjoyable or more important comes along, you can do that activity instead during that time period. If you
do something different during any time period, put a line through what you had planned and write down what you actually did. For each time period in
which you planned an activity, write down: (1) Activity. (2) Mood ratings (0–100).

Exercise: Making My Fear Ladder
Make your Fear Ladder by filling out Worksheets 14.4 and 14.5. Worksheet 14.4 helps you brainstorm
and rate situations you avoid because of anxiety. Once this is done, put on Worksheet 14.5 the item
you rated with the highest anxiety on the top step, and the item you rated with the lowest anxiety
on the bottom step. Fill in the other steps from high to low based on your anxiety ratings. If you rated
some items equally, put them in the order that makes most sense to you, so that your Fear Ladder
steps move from your least feared at the bottom to your most feared situations at the top of the ladder. It’s OK if some of your steps are blank.
Worksheet 14.4. Making a Fear Ladder
1. First, brainstorm a list of situations, events, or people that you avoid because of your anxiety. Write them in
the left-hand column below, in any order.
2. After you complete your list, rate how anxious you feel when you imagine each of the things listed in the first
column. Rate these from 0 to 100, where 0 is no anxiety and 100 is the most anxious you have ever felt. Write
these ratings next to each item in the right-hand column.
What I avoid Rate anxiety (0–100)

Worksheet 15.1. Measuring and Tracking My Moods

improve. This worksheet can also be used to measure and track positive emotions, including happiness.
Mood I am rating:               
Frequency
Circle or mark the number below that most accurately describes how often you experienced this mood this
week:
0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
Never A few times Daily Many times a day All the
time
Strength
Circle or mark below how strongly you felt this mood this week. Rate the time when your mood was the strongest, even if most of the time you did not experience it this strongly. A score of 0 would mean that you did not
feel the mood this week. A score of 100 would show that it was the strongest you have ever felt this mood in
your life. Strongly felt moods will score higher than 70. If you felt the mood at a medium level of strength, give
it a rating between 30 and 70. Rate a mild mood between 1 and 30.
0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100
None Mild Medium Strong Most

Duration
Circle or mark the number below that matches how long your mood lasted. Again, make this rating for the time
during the week when you felt this mood most strongly (think about the rating you gave this mood on the
Strength scale above). If you did not experience the mood this week, circle 0.

any life experiences the other person or persons had that might have contributed to the ways they hurt or
mistreated you.) This is how I can understand what you have done:
6. (Everyone hurts someone else sometimes. When you hurt someone else, how would you want that person
to think about you?) This is how I would want to be viewed if I hurt someone:

Exercise: Forgiving Myself
Some people have great difficulty forgiving themselves; they may have harsh and critical internal voices. If
you are able to forgive others for their faults, but you have a hard time forgiving yourself, you can benefit
from practicing self-forgiveness. This involves learning to view yourself with the same kindness or compassion with which you view others. Worksheet 15.9 on the next page can guide you through this process.

1. This is what I need to forgive myself for:
2. This is the impact that what I did has had on me and others in my life:
3. This is how it continues to affect me and others:
4. This is how I imagine my life will be better if I’m able to forgive myself:
5. Forgiveness often begins with understanding. What life experiences have I had that might have contributed
to what I did?
6. How would I think about someone else who did this?
7. What positive aspects of myself and my life do I tend to ignore when I’m feeling guilt or shame?
8. Forgiveness does not mean that you condone, forget, or deny what was done and the pain you have experienced. Instead, forgiveness means finding a way to let go of your guilt and shame, and understand your
actions from a different perspective. Write with a kind, compassionate voice about how I can forgive myself
for what I have done:
