The History of England
Henry the 4th
Henry the 4th ascended the throne of England much to his own
satisfaction in the year 1399, after having prevailed on his cousin and
predecessor Richard the 2nd, to resign it to him, and to retire for the
rest of his life to Pomfret Castle, where he happened to be
murdered. It is to be supposed that Henry was married since he had
certainly four sons, but it is not in my power to inform the Reader
who was his wife. Be this as it may, he did not live for ever, but falling
ill, his son the Prince of Wales came and took away the crown;
whereupon the King made a long speech, for which I must refer the
Reader to Shakespear's Plays, and the Prince made a still longer.
Things being thus settled between them the King died, and was
succeeded by his son Henry who had previously beat Sir William
Gascoigne.
Henry the 5th
THIS Prince after he succeeded to the throne grew quite reformed
and amiable, forsaking all his disipated companions, and never
thrashing Sir William again. During his reign, Lord Cobham was
burnt alive, but I forget what for. His Majesty then turned his thoughts
to France, where he went and fought the famous Battle of Agincourt.
He afterwards married the King's daughter Catherine, a very
agreable woman by Shakespear's account. In spite of all this
however he died, and was succeeded by his son Henry.
Henry the 6th
I CANNOT say much for this Monarch's sense. Nor would I if I could,
for he was a Lancastrian. I suppose you know all about the Wars
between him and the Duke of York who was of the right side; if you
do not, you had better read some other History, for I shall not be very
diffuse in this, meaning by it only to vent my spleen against, and
shew my Hatred to all those people whose parties or principles do
not suit with mine, and not to give information. This King married
Margaret of Anjou, a Woman whose distresses and misfortunes
were so great as almost to make me who hate her, pity her. It was in
this reign that Joan of Arc lived and made such a row among the
English. They should not have burnt her—but they did. There were
several Battles between the Yorkists and Lancastrians, in which the
former (as they ought) usually conquered. At length they were
entirely overcome; the King was murdered—The Queen was sent
home—and Edward the 4th ascended the Throne.
Edward the 4th
THIS Monarch was famous only for his Beauty and his Courage, of
which the Picture we have here given of him, and his undaunted
behaviour in marrying one Woman while he was engaged to another,
are sufficient proofs. His Wife was Elizabeh Woodville, a Widow who,
poor Woman! was afterwards confined in a Convent by that Monster
of Iniquity and Avarice Henry the 7th. One of Edward's Mistresses
was Jane Shore, who has had a play written about her, but it is a
tragedy and therefore not worth reading. Having performed all these
noble actions, his Majesty died, and was succeeded by his son.
Edward the 5th
THIS unfortunate Prince lived so little a while that nobody had him to
draw his picture. He was murdered by his Uncle's Contrivance,
whose name was Richard the 3rd.
Richard the 3rd
THE Character of this Prince has been in general very severely
treated by Historians, but as he was a York, I am rather inclined to
suppose him a very respectable Man. It has indeed been confidently
asserted that he killed his two Nephews and his Wife, but it has also
been declared that he did not kill his two Nephews, which I am
inclined to believe true; and if this is the case, it may also be affirmed
that he did not kill his Wife, for if Perkin Warbeck was really the Duke
of York, why might not Lambert Simnel be the Widow of Richard.
Whether innocent or guilty, he did not reign long in peace, for Henry
Tudor E. of Richmond as great a villain as ever lived, made a great
fuss about getting the Crown and having killed the King at the battle
of Bosworth, he succeeded to it.
Henry the 7th
THIS Monarch soon after his accession married the Princess
Elizabeth of York, by which alliance he plainly proved that he thought
his own right inferior to hers, tho' he pretended to the contrary. By
this Marriage he had two sons and two Daughters, the elder of which
Daughters was married to the King of Scotland and had the
happiness of being grandmother to one of the first Characters in the
World. But of her, I shall have occasion to speak more at large in
future. The youngest, Mary, married first the King of France and
secondly the D. of Suffolk, by whom she had one daughter,
afterwards the Mother of Lady Jane Grey, who tho' inferior to her
lovely Cousin the Queen of Scots, was yet an amiable young woman
and famous for reading Greek while other people were hunting. It
was in the reign of Henry the 7th that Perkin Warbeck and Lambert
Simnel before mentioned made their appearance, the former of
whom was set in the stocks, took shelter in Beaulieu Abbey, and was
beheaded with the Earl of Warwick, and the latter was taken into the
Kings kitchen. His Majesty died and was succeeded by his son
Henry whose only merit was his not being quite so bad as his
daughter Elizabeth.
Henry the 8th
IT would be an affront to my Readers were I to suppose that they
were not as well acquainted with the particulars of this King's reign
as I am myself. It will therefore be saving them the task of reading
again what they have read before, and myself the trouble of writing
what I do not perfectly recollect, by giving only a slight sketch of the
principal Events which marked his reign. Among these may be
ranked Cardinal Wolsey's telling the father Abbott of Leicester Abbey
that "he was come to lay his bones among them," the reformation in
Religion and the King's riding through the streets of London with
Anna Bullen. It is however but Justice, and my Duty to declare that
this amiable Woman was entirely innocent of the Crimes with which
she was accused, and of which her Beauty, her Elegance, and her
Sprightliness were sufficient proofs, not to mention her solemn
protestations of Innocence, the weakness of the Charges against
her, and the King's Character; all of which add some confirmation,
tho' perhaps but slight ones when in comparison with those before
alledged in her favour. Tho' I do not profess giving many dates, yet
as I think it proper to give some and shall of course make choice of
those which it is most necessary for the Reader to know, I think it
right to inform him that her letter to the King was dated on the 6th of
May. The Crimes and Cruelties of this Prince, were too numerous to
be mentioned, (as this history I trust has fully shown;) and nothing
can be said in his vindication, but that his abolishing Religious
Houses and leaving them to the ruinous depredations of time has
been of infinite use to the landscape of England in general, which
probably was a principal motive for his doing it, since otherwise why
should a Man who was of no Religion himself be at so much trouble
to abolish one which had for ages been established in the Kingdom.
His Majesty's 5th Wife was the Duke of Norfolk's Neice who, tho'
universally acquitted of the crimes for which she was beheaded, has
been by many people supposed to have led an abandoned life
before her Marriage—of this however I have many doubts, since she
was a relation of that noble Duke of Norfolk who was so warm in the
Queen of Scotland's cause, and who at last fell a victim to it. The
Kings last wife contrived to survive him, but with difficulty effected it.
He was succeeded by his only son Edward.
Edward the 6th
AS this prince was only nine years old at the time of his Father's
death, he was considered by many people as too young to govern,
and the late King happening to be of the same opinion, his mother's
Brother the Duke of Somerset was chosen Protector of the realm
during his minority. This Man was on the whole of a very amiable
Character, and is somewhat of a favourite with me, tho' I would by no
means pretend to affirm that he was equal to those first of Men
Robert Earl of Essex, Delamere, or Gilpin. He was beheaded, of
which he might with reason have been proud, had he known that
such was the death of Mary Queen of Scotland; but as it was
impossible that he should be conscious of what had never
happened, it does not appear that he felt particularly delighted with
the manner of it. After his decease the Duke of Northumberland had
the care of the King and the Kingdom, and performed his trust of
both so well that the King died and the Kingdom was left to his
daughter in law the Lady Jane Grey, who has been already
mentioned as—reading Greek. Whether she really understood that
language or whether such a study proceeded only from an excess of
vanity for which I believe she was always rather remarkable, is
uncertain. Whatever might be the cause, she preserved the same
appearance of knowledge, and contempt of what was generally
esteemed pleasure, during the whole of her life, for she declared
herself displeased with being appointed Queen, and while
conducting to the scaffold, she wrote a sentence in Latin and another
in Greek on seeing the dead Body of her Husband accidentally
passing that way.
Mary
THIS woman had the good luck of being advanced to the throne of
England, in spite of the superior pretensions, Merit, and Beauty of
her Cousins Mary Queen of Scotland and Jane Grey. Nor can I pity
the Kingdom for the misfortunes they experienced during her Reign,
since they fully deserved them, for having allowed her succeed her
Brother—which was a double piece of folly, since they might have
foreseen that as she died without children, she would be succeeded
by that disgrace to humanity, that pest of society, Elizabeth. Many
were the people who fell martyrs to the protestant Religion during
her reign; I suppose not fewer than a dozen. She married Philip King
of Spain who in her sister's reign was famous for building Armadas.
She died without issue, and then the dreadful moment came in which
the destroyer of all comfort, the deceitful Betrayer of trust reposed in
her, and the Murderess of her Cousin succeeded to the Throne.——
Elizabeth
IT was the peculiar misfortune of this Woman to have bad Ministers
—Since wicked as she herself was, she could not have committed
such extensive mischeif, had not these vile and abandoned Men
connived at, and encouraged her in her Crimes. I know that it has by
many people been asserted and believed that Lord Burle'igh, Sir
Francis Walsingham, and the rest of those who filled the chief offices
of State were deserving, experienced, and able Ministers. But oh!
how blinded such writers and such Readers must be to true Merit, to
Merit despised, neglected and defamed, if they can persist in such
opinions when they reflect that these men, these boasted men were
such scandals to their Country and their sex as to allow and assist
their Queen in confining for the space of nineteen years, a Woman
who if the claims of Relationship and Merit were of no avail, yet as a
Queen and as one who condescended to place confidence in her,
had every reason to expect assistance and protection; and at length
in allowing Elizabeth to bring this amiable Woman to an untimely,
unmerited, and scandalous Death. Can any one if he reflects but for
a moment on this blot, this everlasting blot upon their understanding
and their Character, allow any praise to Lord Burleigh or Sir Francis
Walsingham? Oh! what must this bewitching Princess whose only
friend was then the Duke of Norfolk, and whose only ones now Mr
Whitaker, Mrs Lefroy, Mrs Knight and myself, who was abandoned
by her son, confined by her Cousin, abused, reproached and vilified
by all, what must not her most noble mind have suffered when
informed that Elizabeth had given orders for her Death! Yet she bore
it with a most unshaken fortitude, firm in her mind; constant in her
Religion; and prepared herself to meet the cruel fate to which she
was doomed, with a magnanimity that would alone proceed from
conscious Innocence. And yet could you Reader have believed it
possible that some hardened and zealous Protestants have even
abused her for that steadfastness in the Catholic Religion which
reflected on her so much credit? But this is striking proof of their
narrow souls and prejudiced Judgements who accuse her. She was
executed in the Great Hall at Fortheringay Castle (sacred Place!) on
Wednesday the 8th of February 1586—to the everlasting Reproach
of Elizabeth, her Ministers, and of England in general. It may not be
unnecessary before I entirely conclude my account of this ill-fated
Queen, to observe that she had been accused of several crimes
during the time of her reigning in Scotland, of which I now most
seriously do assure my Reader that she was entirely innocent;
having never been guilty of anything more than Imprudencies into
which she was betrayed by the openness of her Heart, her Youth,
and her Education. Having I trust by this assurance entirely done
away every Suspicion and every doubt which might have arisen in
the Reader's mind, from what other Historians have written of her, I
shall proceed to mention the remaining Events that marked
Elizabeth's reign. It was about this time that Sir Francis Drake the
first English Navigator who sailed round the World, lived, to be the
ornament of his Country and his profession. Yet great as he was,
and justly celebrated as a sailor, I cannot help foreseeing that he will
be equalled in this or the next Century by one who tho' now but
young, already promises to answer all the ardent and sanguine
expectations of his Relations and Friends, amongst whom I may
class the amiable Lady to whom this work is dedicated, and my no
less amiable self.
Though of a different profession, and shining in a different sphere
of Life, yet equally conspicuous in the Character of an Earl, as Drake
was in that of a Sailor, was Robert Devereux Lord Essex. This
unfortunate young Man was not unlike in character to that equally
unfortunate one Frederic Delamere. The simile may be carried still
farther, and Elizabeth the torment of Essex may be compared to the
Emmeline of Delamere. It would be endless to recount the
misfortunes of this noble and gallant Earl. It is sufficient to say that
he was beheaded on the 25th of Feb. after having been Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland, after having clapped his hand on his sword,
and after performing many other services to his Country. Elizabeth
did not long survive his loss, and died so miserable that were it not
an injury to the memory of Mary I should pity her.
James the 1st
THOUGH this King had some faults, among which and as the most
principal, was his allowing his Mother's death, yet considered on the
whole I cannot help liking him. He married Anne of Denmark, and
had several Children; fortunately for him his eldest son Prince Henry
died before his father or he might have experienced the evils which
befell his unfortunate Brother.
As I am myself partial to the roman catholic religion, it is with
infinite regret that I am obliged to blame the Behaviour of any
Member of it: yet Truth being I think very excusable in an Historian, I
am necessitated to say that in this reign the roman Catholics of
England did not behave like Gentlemen to the protestants. Their
Behaviour indeed to the Royal Family and both Houses of
Parliament might justly be considered by them as very uncivil, and
even Sir Henry Percy tho' certainly the best bred man of the party,
had none of that general politeness which is so universally pleasing,
as his attentions were entirely confined to Lord Mounteagle.
Sir Walter Raleigh flourished in this and the preceeding reign, and
is by many people held in great veneration and respect—But as he
was an enemy of the noble Essex, I have nothing to say in praise of
him, and must refer all those who may wish to be acquainted with
the particulars of his life, to Mr Sheridan's play of the Critic, where
they will find many interesting anecdotes as well of him as of his
friend Sir Christopher Hatton.—His Majesty was of that amiable
disposition which inclines to Freindship, and in such points was
possessed of a keener penetration in discovering Merit than many
other people. I once heard an excellent sharade on a Carpet, of
which the subject I am now on reminds me, and as I think it may
afford my Readers some amusement to find it out, I shall here take
the liberty of presenting it to them.
Sharade
My first is what my second was to King James the 1st, and you
tread on my whole.
The principal favourites of his Majesty were Car, who was
afterwards created Earl of Somerset and whose name perhaps may
have some share in the above mentioned sharade, and George
Villiers afterwards Duke of Buckingham. On his Majesty's death he
was succeeded by his son Charles.
Charles the 1st
THIS amiable Monarch seems born to have suffered misfortunes
equal to those of his lovely Grandmother; misfortunes which he
could not deserve since he was her descendant. Never certainly
were there before so many detestable Characters at one time in
England as in this period of its History; never were amiable men so
scarce. The number of them throughout the whole Kingdom
amounting only to five, besides the inhabitants of Oxford who were
always loyal to their King and faithful to his interests. The names of
this noble five who never forgot the duty of the subject, or swerved
from their attachment to his Majesty, were as follows—The King
himself, ever steadfast in his own support—Archbishop Laud, Earl of
Strafford, Viscount Faulkland and Duke of Ormond, who were
scarcely less strenuous or zealous in the cause. While the villains of
the time would make too long a list to be written or read; I shall
therefore content myself with mentioning the leaders of the Gang.
Cromwell, Fairfax, Hampden, and Pym may be considered as the
original Causers of all the disturbances, Distresses, and Civil Wars in
which England for many years was embroiled. In this reign as well as
in that of Elizabeth, I am obliged in spite of my attachment to the
Scotch, to consider them as equally guilty with the generality of the
English, since they dared to think differently from their Sovereign, to
forget the Adoration which as Stuarts it was their Duty to pay them,
to rebel against, dethrone and imprison the unfortunate Mary; to
oppose, to deceive, and to sell the no less unfortunate Charles. The
Events of this Monarch's reign are too numerous for my pen, and
indeed the recital of any Events (except what I make myself) is
uninteresting to me; my principal reason for undertaking the History
of England being to prove the innocence of the Queen of Scotland,
which I flatter myself with having effectually done, and to abuse
Elizabeth, tho' I am rather fearful of having fallen short in the latter
part of my scheme.—As therefore it is not my intention to give any
particular account of the distresses into which this King was involved
through the misconduct and Cruelty of his Parliament, I shall satisfy
myself with vindicating him from the Reproach of Arbitrary and
tyrannical Government with which he has often been charged. This, I
feel, is not difficult to be done, for with one argument I am certain of
satisfying every sensble and well disposed person whose opinions
have been properly guided by a good Education—and this Argument
is that he was a STUART.
