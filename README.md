# NestEnterpriseStack

## Overview

This repository contains an NX monorepo setup for developing scalable and efficient NestJS microservices, optimized for deployment on AWS. Designed with enterprise-grade standards, it integrates key technologies like Docker, PostgreSQL (AWS RDS), Redis (AWS ElastiCache), and incorporates CI/CD pipelines using AWS services.

## Key Features

- **NestJS**: A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
- **Nx Monorepo**: A suite of powerful, extensible dev tools to facilitate the development of applications at any scale, integrating seamlessly with modern technologies and libraries while providing robust CLI, caching, and more.
- **Husky & Commitlint**: These tools ensure consistent commit formats for better version control.
- **ESLint**: A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on patterns in JavaScript.
- **Jest**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
- **Docker**: For environment consistency and containerization of applications.

## Architecture
